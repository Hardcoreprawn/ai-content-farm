## Testing Strategy: Defensive Input/Output Contracts

All tests focus on **defensive programming** - ensuring each module:

### 1. **Input Validation**
- ✅ Rejects None, empty strings, invalid types
- ✅ Handles missing required fields gracefully
- ✅ Processes mixed valid/invalid batches without crashing
- ✅ No silent failures - meaningful error messages

### 2. **Output Contracts**
- ✅ Return types guaranteed (float, list, dict, bool, etc.)
- ✅ Numeric values bounded appropriately (0-1 for scores)
- ✅ List operations never mutate input data
- ✅ Required fields always present in responses

### 3. **Edge Cases**
- ✅ Very short content (2 chars)
- ✅ Very long content (10K+ chars)
- ✅ Empty lists and dicts
- ✅ Missing/null fields
- ✅ Duplicate items in batches
- ✅ Invalid UTF-8 handling
- ✅ Unicode content with emojis

### 4. **Fail-Safe Design**
- ✅ Functions handle all error conditions
- ✅ Exceptions raised with clear messages
- ✅ No unexpected type errors from downstream
- ✅ Defensive defaults for missing config

## Critical Test Coverage

### Quality Config Module (39 tests)
```python
✅ Constants exist and are immutable
✅ Defaults structured correctly
✅ Regex patterns compile without error
✅ Paywall domain set non-empty
✅ Thresholds in logical order (short < medium < long)
✅ Helper functions defensive on invalid input
```

### Quality Dedup Module (30 tests)
```python
✅ Hash produces 64-char hex (consistent, deterministic)
✅ Deduplication removes identical items
✅ Input lists never mutated during processing
✅ Empty input returns empty output
✅ Layer 1/2/3 dedup boundaries correct
✅ Handles None and invalid items gracefully
```

### Quality Detectors Module (40 tests)
```python
✅ Paywall detection: Keywords AND domains work
✅ Comparison detection: vs/pros/cons patterns trigger
✅ Listicle detection: Top N patterns caught
✅ Content length: Short/medium/long assessed correctly
✅ All detectors return (bool, penalty) or dict
✅ Penalties bounded 0-1 (valid probability)
✅ Invalid input doesn't crash, returns safe defaults
```

### Quality Scoring Module (40 tests)
```python
✅ Base score for valid (title+content) = 0.5
✅ Penalties stack correctly (not exceeding max)
✅ Ranking by score (descending) with max results
✅ Diversity enforcement: max 3 articles per source
✅ Score always float in range [0.0, 1.0]
✅ Metadata added without input mutation
✅ Invalid items skipped with warnings
```

### Quality Gate Pipeline (22 tests)
```python
✅ Item validation checks required fields
✅ Batch validation returns (valid, errors) tuple
✅ Process items returns structured dict: {status, items, stats}
✅ Async emission to queue works with proper formatting
✅ Pipeline status includes counts and timing
✅ Error handling preserves failed items for reporting
✅ Configuration overrides applied correctly
```

## Key Defensive Properties Protected

| Property | Test Name | Why It Matters |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Hash consistency | `test_hash_consistent` | Dedup determinism - must be repeatable |
| No input mutation | `test_no_mutation_of_input` | Data integrity for reprocessing |
| Output structure | `test_process_items_output_structure` | Downstream services depend on format |
| Score bounds | `test_calculate_score_returns_bounded_float` | Prevents invalid values flowing downstream |
| Diversity enforcement | `test_rank_items_diversity_filtering` | Publishing fair selection across sources |
| Error propagation | `test_validate_item_required_fields` | Quality issues caught early, not as surprises |
| Type safety | All tests include type assertions | Prevents silent type coercion bugs |

## What These Tests Protect Against

✅ **Accidental Changes**: Test suite immediately catches if:
- Logic changed without intention
- Thresholds modified incorrectly  
- Deduplication or filtering broken
- Configuration defaults lost
- Error handling disabled

✅ **Downstream Failures**: Tests ensure:
- Output format always valid for consumers
- No type mismatches or missing fields
- Null/None values handled safely
- Array operations don't crash on edge cases

✅ **Performance Regressions**: Tests verify:
- Dedup actually removes items (quality control)
- Diversity limits prevent bias (fairness)
- Scoring produces consistent results (reproducibility)

✅ **Data Integrity**: Tests guarantee:
- Input data never modified (safe for retries)
- Hashes deterministic (can validate consistency)
- Errors tracked for investigation (debuggability)

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
cd /workspaces/ai-content-farm/containers/content-collector
python -m pytest tests/test_quality_*.py -v

# Specific module
python -m pytest tests/test_quality_config.py -v

# With coverage
python -m pytest tests/test_quality_*.py --cov=quality_gate --cov-report=html

# Fast run (no verbose)
python -m pytest tests/test_quality_*.py -q
```

## What's NOT Tested (By Design)

- Performance/timing tests (unit tests, not benchmarks)
- Integration with real Azure services (use staging environment)
- Full end-to-end pipeline (use test data fixtures)
- External API responses (mocked in tests)
- Concurrency/race conditions (async tests, but not stress tested)

These are validated through:
- Staging environment integration tests
- Performance profiling in deployment
- End-to-end test runs with real data
