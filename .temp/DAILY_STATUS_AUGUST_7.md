✅ Key Vault: aicontentstagingkvt0t36m
✅ Storage Account: hottopicsstoraget0t36m  
✅ Application Insights: ai-content-staging-insights
✅ Service Plan: ai-content-staging-plan (Consumption Y1)
```

### 🔍 Content Generation Analysis

**❌ No Azure-Generated Content Found**
- Function app is running but **no function code deployed**
- GetHotTopics function exists locally but not published to Azure
- Storage container exists but is empty (no generated content)
- Function endpoint returns 404 (no deployed functions)

**✅ Local Content Generated**
Found 7 articles in `/site/content/articles/` dated 2025-08-05:
- AI job interviews content
- Airbnb AI-generated images controversy

### 🔄 GitHub Actions Review

**Recent Runs (Last 16 hours):**
- ❌ Build and Deploy MkDocs (scheduled) - Failed
- ❌ Infrastructure deployment - Failed due to state migration prompt
- ❌ Previous runs also showing failures

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Function deployment never completed** - Infrastructure exists but no code deployed
2. **Pipeline state migration** - Terraform prompting for user input
3. **MkDocs build failures** - Content publishing pipeline broken

## 🚨 Critical Gap Identified

**The function app infrastructure exists but NO FUNCTION CODE has been deployed!**

This explains why:
- No new content in Azure storage
- Function endpoints return 404
- No automated content generation happening

## 🎯 Today's Priority Action Plan

### 🚀 IMMEDIATE (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Deploy function code to Azure**
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/ai-content-farm/azure-function-deploy
   func azure functionapp publish ai-content-staging-func
   ```

2. **Test function deployment**
   ```bash
   curl https://ai-content-staging-func.azurewebsites.net/api/GetHotTopics
   ```

### 🔧 URGENT (Next 1-2 hours)  
1. **Configure Reddit API credentials** in Key Vault
2. **Fix MkDocs publishing pipeline** 
3. **Verify content generation flow end-to-end**

### 📈 TODAY'S GOALS
1. ✅ Get automated content generation working
2. ✅ Publish existing content to live site
3. ✅ Fix pipeline deployment issues
4. ✅ Establish monitoring for content generation

## 💡 Key Insights

**Yesterday's Success:** Perfect infrastructure foundation
**Today's Challenge:** Bridge the gap between infrastructure and application

The infrastructure team did excellent work - everything is deployed and ready. Now we need to deploy the application code to make it functional.

**Status:** Infrastructure ✅ | Application Code ❌ | Content Pipeline ❌  
**Next Action:** Deploy function code (15 minutes)  
**ETA to Working System:** 1-2 hours
