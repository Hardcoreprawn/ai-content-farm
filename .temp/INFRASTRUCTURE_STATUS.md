# Infrastructure Status

✅ **Bootstrap Infrastructure**: Deployed  
✅ **Remote State**: Configured  
✅ **GitHub OIDC**: Ready  
✅ **Main Infrastructure**: Deployed (Local)
⚠️  **Pipeline**: Failed due to state migration prompt

## Deployment Summary
- **Local Deployment**: ✅ SUCCESS - 19 resources created
- **Function App**: `ai-content-staging-func.azurewebsites.net`
- **Key Vault**: `aicontentstagingkvt0t36m`
- **Storage**: `hottopicsstoraget0t36m`

## Pipeline Issue
The GitHub Actions pipeline failed because Terraform prompted for user input about migrating from local to remote state. This is expected when there's existing local state.

## Next Steps
1. Clean up the local state files that weren't gitignored
2. Re-run pipeline or use local deployment for now
3. Function app is ready for code deploymentructure Status

✅ **Bootstrap Infrastructure**: Deployed  
✅ **Remote State**: Configured  
✅ **GitHub OIDC**: Ready  
📋 **Next**: Deploy main infrastructure via pipeline
