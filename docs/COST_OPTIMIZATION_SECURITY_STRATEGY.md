# Cost Optimization Security Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the security mitigations implemented to offset the security reductions made for cost optimization.

## Cost Optimizations Made

### 1. Container Registry: Consolidated + Basic SKU (-$50/month)
**Changes:**
- Consolidated from per-environment registries to shared registry (-$20/month)
- Downgraded from Standard to Basic SKU (-$30/month total)

**Security Trade-offs:**
- No vulnerability scanning
- No network restrictions  
- No geo-replication
- Shared registry across environments

**Security Mitigations:**
- Enhanced RBAC with managed identities only
- Disabled admin account completely
- Container image scanning in CI/CD pipeline using Trivy
- Regular security scans in GitHub Actions
- Environment isolation through image tagging strategy
- Comprehensive tag management and cleanup policies

### 2. Service Bus: Premium â†’ Standard (-$600+/month)
**Security Trade-offs:**
- Cannot disable public network access
- No customer-managed encryption keys
- No virtual network integration

**Security Mitigations:**
- Disabled local authentication (Azure AD only)
- Minimum TLS 1.2 enforcement
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting
- Access restricted through Azure AD roles
- Network access logs monitored

### 3. Consolidated Log Analytics Workspaces (-$5-10/month)
**Security Trade-offs:**
- Shared logging workspace

**Security Mitigations:**
- Role-based access to logs
- Retention optimized but adequate for incident response
- Enhanced query auditing

## Enhanced Security Measures

### 1. CI/CD Security Pipeline
- Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Dependency scanning with Dependabot
- Security linting with Semgrep
- Infrastructure security scanning with Checkov

### 2. Runtime Security
- Application Insights for anomaly detection
- Cost alerts for unusual usage patterns
- Resource locks to prevent accidental deletion
- Managed identity authentication everywhere possible

### 3. Access Control
- No service principal keys stored
- GitHub OIDC authentication
- Principle of least privilege RBAC
- Regular access reviews through automation

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting
- Budget alerts at 50% and 90% thresholds
- Security metric alerts for Azure OpenAI usage
- Diagnostic logging enabled for all security-relevant services
- Log Analytics queries for security monitoring

## Cost vs Security Balance

**Total Monthly Savings: ~$655-665**
- Container Registry Consolidation: $50/month
- Service Bus: $600+/month  
- Log Analytics: $5-10/month

**Security Investment:**
- Enhanced CI/CD security scanning (free in GitHub)
- Better monitoring and alerting (minimal cost)
- Automated security reviews (development time)

## Recommendations for Production

For production environments, consider:
1. Upgrade to Standard Container Registry for vulnerability scanning
2. Implement network security groups and private endpoints
3. Use Premium Service Bus with customer-managed keys for high-sensitivity workloads
4. Implement Azure Sentinel for advanced security monitoring

## Review Schedule

- Monthly: Review security alerts and cost usage
- Quarterly: Assess if security investments can be increased
- Annually: Review if production workloads justify premium security features
