# Coordinated Platform Modernization Plan

**Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **UPDATED - APPROACH CHANGED**

## üîÑ **PLAN UPDATED - FastAPI-Native Approach**

**This plan has been superseded by a better approach. See:**
üìã **[FastAPI-Native Modernization Plan](./FASTAPI_NATIVE_MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md)**

**Why the change?**
- ‚ùå **Previous approach**: Complex exception handlers fighting FastAPI patterns
- ‚úÖ **New approach**: Use FastAPI's native Pydantic response models and dependency injection

**Benefits of new approach:**
- üöÄ **Simpler implementation** - No complex exception handling
- üîß **Better maintainability** - Works with FastAPI, not against it  
- üìä **Type safety** - Full Pydantic validation and auto-docs
- ‚ö° **Better performance** - No exception handler overhead
- üß™ **Easier testing** - Standard FastAPI patterns

## Original Analysis (Still Valid)

### **Infrastructure Components**

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 40-50% cost reduction through infrastructure optimization
- Consistent API patterns across all services
- Better observability and monitoring
- Simplified architecture with cleaner separation of concerns

## Current State Analysis

### Infrastructure Components
- **Container Apps Environment** with Log Analytics integration
- **Shared Container Registry** (Basic SKU) across all environments
- **Service Bus Standard** for event processing
- **Event Grid** for blob storage events
- **4 Container Apps**: Site Generator, Content Collector, Content Ranker, Content Generator
- **Scale-to-zero capability** for most workloads

### Current Resource Allocation
```
Site Generator:    min=1, max=3, 0.5 CPU, 1Gi RAM (always-on for public access)
Content Collector: min=0, max=2, 0.5 CPU, 1Gi RAM
Content Ranker:    min=0, max=2, 0.5 CPU, 1Gi RAM  
Content Generator: min=0, max=5, 0.5 CPU, 1Gi RAM
```

### API Alignment Issues (High Priority)
- **Inconsistent Response Formats**: Each service uses different response structures
- **Non-Standard Endpoints**: Services use root-level endpoints instead of `/api/{service}/` pattern
- **Varying Error Handling**: Different HTTP status codes and error message formats
- **Missing Required Endpoints**: No `/docs` endpoints, inconsistent `/health` patterns

## Coordinated Implementation Strategy

## Coordinated Implementation Strategy

#### **Week 3-4: Optimization Planning**
**Day 8-12: Resource Right-sizing Analysis**
- [ ] Analyze CPU and memory usage per service type:
  - Content Collector: API calls only ‚Üí likely 0.25 CPU + 0.5Gi
  - Content Ranker: Computation ‚Üí likely 0.5 CPU + 1Gi  
  - Content Generator: AI processing ‚Üí likely 1.0 CPU + 2Gi
  - Site Generator: Static files ‚Üí likely 0.25 CPU + 0.5Gi
- [ ] Test resource changes in development environment
- [ ] Validate performance impact of resource reduction

**Day 13-14: Architecture Alternatives Evaluation**
- [ ] **Option A - HTTP Webhooks**: Design direct container-to-container communication
- [ ] **Option B - Simple Polling**: Timer-based pipeline orchestration
