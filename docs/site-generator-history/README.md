## Key Achievements Documented

### URL/Filename Consistency (Phases 1-3)
The most recent work focused on eliminating 404 errors by ensuring URLs match filenames exactly:

1. **Phase 1**: AI-powered metadata generation in processor
   - Added MetadataGenerator service
   - AI translation for non-English titles
   - Automatic slug generation
   - Cost tracking (~$0.0001 per article)

2. **Phase 2**: Integration into article processing pipeline
   - Modified ArticleGenerationService
   - Added metadata fields to article results
   - Provenance tracking
   - 5 data contract tests

3. **Phase 3**: Site generator simplification
   - Removed complex slug generation logic
   - Use processor-provided metadata directly
   - Backwards compatible with legacy articles
   - 3 new integration tests

**Result**: Perfect URL/filename match, no more 404 errors!

### Architecture Evolution
- **Processor**: "Smart" - AI-powered metadata generation upstream
- **Site Generator**: "Dumb" - Just uses processor data
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, easier maintenance

## Test Coverage
- Content Processor: 207 tests (includes 5 metadata tests)
- Site Generator: 195 tests (includes 3 metadata integration tests)
- All passing âœ…

## For Future Reference
These documents show the evolution of the site generator from complex slug generation to simple, processor-driven metadata usage. Useful for:
- Understanding design decisions
- Troubleshooting similar issues
- Learning from the refactoring process
- Onboarding new developers
