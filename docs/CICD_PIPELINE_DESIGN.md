## 🏗️ **Pipeline Architecture**

### **1. Pre-Commit Stage (Local/Git Hooks)**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Code Change] --> B[Pre-commit Hooks]
    B --> C[Linting & Formatting]
    B --> D[Basic Security Scan]
    B --> E[Unit Tests]
    C --> F[Commit Allowed]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

**Tools & Actions:**
