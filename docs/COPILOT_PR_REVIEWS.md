# GitHub Copilot PR Reviews Setup

This document explains how to use GitHub Copilot for AI-powered PR reviews instead of direct OpenAI API integration.

## Overview

The AI review actions are configured to be **optional by default** and will use GitHub Copilot PR reviews for AI-powered analysis instead of direct API calls. This approach:

- ✅ Uses GitHub's native Copilot integration
- ✅ No additional API keys required
- ✅ Integrated with GitHub's PR workflow
- ✅ Cost-effective (included with Copilot subscription)
- ✅ Maintains security within GitHub ecosystem

## Configuration Status

### Current Setup (Default)
- **AI Review Actions**: Disabled (OpenAI API key not provided)
- **Copilot PR Reviews**: Ready to use (no additional setup required)
- **Security Scanning**: Fully functional (Trivy, Semgrep, etc.)
- **Cost Analysis**: Fully functional (Infracost integration)

### Optional Azure AI Services
If you want to enable Azure AI services instead of direct OpenAI:

```yaml
# In .github/workflows/cicd-pipeline.yml
- uses: ./.github/actions/ai-review-security
  with:
    # For Azure OpenAI service:
    openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    # Or use Azure AI endpoint directly
    azure-ai-endpoint: ${{ secrets.AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT }}
    azure-ai-key: ${{ secrets.AZURE_AI_KEY }}
```

## Using GitHub Copilot for PR Reviews

### 1. Enable Copilot PR Reviews

In your repository settings:
1. Go to **Settings** → **General** → **Pull Requests**
2. Enable **"Allow Copilot to review pull requests"**
3. Configure review triggers and perspectives

### 2. Configure Review Perspectives

Create `.github/copilot-reviews.yml`:

```yaml
# Copilot PR Review Configuration
reviews:
  security:
    enabled: true
    focus:
      - "Authentication and authorization"
      - "Input validation and sanitization"
      - "Cryptographic implementations"
      - "Infrastructure security"
      - "Dependency vulnerabilities"
      - "Secrets management"
    
  cost:
    enabled: true
    focus:
      - "Resource rightsizing"
      - "Auto-scaling configuration"
      - "Storage optimization"
      - "Network costs"
      - "Serverless vs container efficiency"
    
  operations:
    enabled: true
    focus:
      - "Deployment reliability"
      - "Monitoring and observability"
      - "Scaling and performance"
      - "Configuration management"
      - "Incident response readiness"

triggers:
  - pull_request
  - push_to_pr

review_depth: comprehensive
include_suggestions: true
```

### 3. Copilot Review Commands

Use these commands in PR comments to trigger specific reviews:

```bash
# Security perspective review
@github-copilot review this PR for security issues

# Cost optimization review  
@github-copilot analyze the cost impact of these changes

# Operations readiness review
@github-copilot review the operational readiness of this deployment

# Comprehensive review
@github-copilot provide a comprehensive review covering security, cost, and operations
```

### 4. Integration with Existing Workflow

The current workflow provides:

1. **Security Scanning** → Detailed tool-based analysis
2. **Cost Analysis** → Infracost-based cost impact
3. **Copilot Reviews** → AI-powered insights and recommendations
4. **Ephemeral Environments** → Live testing environments

This combination gives you:
- ✅ **Tool-based validation** (security scanners, cost tools)
- ✅ **AI-powered insights** (Copilot reviews)
- ✅ **Live environment testing** (ephemeral deployments)

## Benefits of Copilot vs Direct API Integration

| Aspect | GitHub Copilot | Direct OpenAI API |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Setup** | No additional setup | Requires API keys |
| **Cost** | Included with Copilot | Pay-per-use |
| **Security** | GitHub-native | External API calls |
| **Integration** | Native PR workflow | Custom implementation |
| **Context** | Full repo context | Limited context |
| **Maintenance** | GitHub-managed | Custom maintenance |

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Copilot Instructions

Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:

```markdown
# AI Content Farm - Copilot Review Instructions

## Security Review Focus
- Check for authentication bypasses in Azure Container Apps
- Validate Key Vault integration security
- Review Terraform security configurations
- Analyze Docker container security

## Cost Review Focus  
- Evaluate Container App scaling policies
- Check for cost-optimized storage tiers
- Review resource sizing for workloads
- Analyze data transfer costs

## Operations Review Focus
- Validate deployment automation
- Check monitoring and alerting setup
- Review backup and disaster recovery
- Analyze scaling and performance
```

### Workflow Integration

The current workflow structure supports both approaches:

```yaml
# Current: Uses security tools + Copilot reviews
jobs:
  security-scan:
    # Tool-based scanning (Trivy, Semgrep, etc.)
    
  ai-security-review:
    # Optional AI review (disabled by default)
    # Uses Copilot when OpenAI key not provided
    
  cost-analysis:
    # Infracost integration
    
  # Copilot reviews happen automatically on PR
```

## Migration to Azure AI Services (Optional)

If you later want to use Azure AI services:

### 1. Azure OpenAI Service

```yaml
# Add to GitHub Secrets
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY: "your-azure-openai-key"
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT: "https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/"

# Update workflow
- uses: ./.github/actions/ai-review-security
  with:
    openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    openai-endpoint: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT }}
```

### 2. Azure AI Language Services

```yaml
# Add to GitHub Secrets  
AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT: "https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
AZURE_AI_KEY: "your-ai-service-key"

# Update actions to use Azure AI SDK instead of OpenAI
```

## Recommended Approach

For your AI Content Farm project, the recommended setup is:

1. **Keep AI review actions disabled** (current default)
2. **Use GitHub Copilot for PR reviews** (no additional setup)
3. **Leverage existing security and cost tools** (already implemented)
4. **Use ephemeral environments for testing** (already implemented)

This provides comprehensive coverage while maintaining simplicity and cost-effectiveness.

## Testing the Setup

1. Create a test PR with infrastructure changes
2. Observe the security scanning and cost analysis results
3. Use Copilot commands for AI insights
4. Verify ephemeral environment deployment

The workflow will run all tool-based analysis while Copilot provides AI-powered insights through the native GitHub interface.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: robust automated analysis and intelligent AI insights, all within the GitHub ecosystem.
