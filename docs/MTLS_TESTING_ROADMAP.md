# üß™ mTLS Testing & Validation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap provides a structured approach to testing and validating the mTLS implementation, from basic infrastructure validation to comprehensive end-to-end testing.

## üéØ Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Validation ‚ö° (Quick - 5-10 minutes)
**Goal**: Verify basic mTLS infrastructure is in place

**Prerequisites**:
- mTLS infrastructure deployed via Terraform
- Certificates generated and stored in Key Vault
- Container apps deployed with Dapr sidecars

**Tests**:
1. **Certificate Validation**
   ```bash
   # Quick certificate check
   ./scripts/quick-mtls-validation.sh --domain yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **DNS Resolution**
   ```bash
   nslookup collector.yourdomain.com
   nslookup processor.yourdomain.com
   nslookup site-gen.yourdomain.com
   ```

3. **Basic Service Connectivity**
   ```bash
   curl -k https://collector.yourdomain.com/health
   curl -k https://processor.yourdomain.com/health
   curl -k https://site-gen.yourdomain.com/health
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ All certificates present and valid
- ‚úÖ DNS resolution working
- ‚úÖ Basic HTTP connectivity established

---

### Phase 2: Container Self-Testing üè• (Medium - 10-15 minutes)
**Goal**: Validate containers can self-diagnose mTLS status

**Prerequisites**:
- Phase 1 completed successfully
- Enhanced health endpoints integrated into containers

**Tests**:
1. **Enhanced Health Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Test detailed health with mTLS validation
   curl https://collector.yourdomain.com/health/detailed
   curl https://processor.yourdomain.com/health/detailed
   curl https://site-gen.yourdomain.com/health/detailed
   ```

2. **mTLS-Specific Health**
   ```bash
   # Test mTLS-specific endpoints
   curl https://collector.yourdomain.com/health/mtls
   curl https://processor.yourdomain.com/health/mtls
   curl https://site-gen.yourdomain.com/health/mtls
   ```

3. **Dependency Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test inter-service dependency health
   curl https://collector.yourdomain.com/health/dependencies
   curl https://processor.yourdomain.com/health/dependencies
   curl https://site-gen.yourdomain.com/health/pipeline
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ All enhanced health endpoints responding
- ‚úÖ mTLS status reports as healthy
- ‚úÖ Dependency checks pass

---

### Phase 3: Inter-Service Communication üîó (Comprehensive - 15-20 minutes)
**Goal**: Validate secure communication between all services

**Prerequisites**:
- Phase 2 completed successfully
- All services running and healthy

**Tests**:
1. **Direct mTLS Communication**
   ```bash
   # Test with client certificates
   curl --cert /etc/ssl/certs/collector.crt \
        --key /etc/ssl/certs/collector.key \
        https://processor.yourdomain.com/health
   ```

2. **Dapr Service Invocation**
   ```bash
   # Test Dapr-mediated communication
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/content-processor/method/health
   ```

3. **Pipeline Flow Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test actual data flow through pipeline
   curl -X POST https://collector.yourdomain.com/api/collect \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"test": true}'
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ mTLS handshakes successful
- ‚úÖ Dapr service invocation working
- ‚úÖ Data flows through pipeline securely

---

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Validation üöÄ (Complete - 20-30 minutes)
**Goal**: Full end-to-end validation with performance testing

**Prerequisites**:
- Phase 3 completed successfully
- Monitoring infrastructure deployed

**Tests**:
1. **Comprehensive Validation Suite**
   ```bash
   # Run full validation
   python scripts/validate-mtls-implementation.py \
     --domain yourdomain.com \
     --output validation-results.json \
     --verbose
   ```

2. **Performance Impact Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test performance with mTLS overhead
   ab -n 100 -c 10 https://collector.yourdomain.com/health
   ```

3. **Failover and Recovery Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test certificate rotation
   ./scripts/certificate-management.sh rotate content-collector
   
   # Test service recovery
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/content-collector
   ```

4. **Security Validation**
   ```bash
   # Test certificate validation
   openssl s_client -connect collector.yourdomain.com:443 -verify 5
   
   # Test rejected connections without certificates
   curl --insecure https://processor.yourdomain.com/health
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ All validation tests pass
- ‚úÖ Performance impact acceptable (<50ms overhead)
- ‚úÖ Failover mechanisms working
- ‚úÖ Security properly enforced

## ü§ñ Automated Testing Integration

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Add to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: mTLS Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate-mtls:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Quick mTLS Validation
        run: |
          chmod +x scripts/quick-mtls-validation.sh
          ./scripts/quick-mtls-validation.sh --domain ${{ secrets.MTLS_DOMAIN }}
          
      - name: Comprehensive Validation
        run: |
          python scripts/validate-mtls-implementation.py \
            --domain ${{ secrets.MTLS_DOMAIN }} \
