# GitHub Actions Workflow Strategy

## Overview
Streamlined workflow setup to eliminate redundancy and ensure comprehensive security coverage.

## Workflow Organization

### 🔒 Security & Cost Validation (`security-and-cost-validation.yml`)
**Triggers:** ALL pushes, ALL PRs, weekly schedule, manual
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive security and cost analysis on every change
- **Scope:** All code (no path restrictions for security)
- **Jobs:**
  - Python security scanning (Safety, Semgrep, Trivy)
  - Terraform security (Checkov)
  - Infrastructure cost analysis
  - SBOM generation
- **Rationale:** Security should run on ALL changes, not just infrastructure

### 🚀 Staging Deployment (`staging-deployment.yml`) 
**Triggers:** Push to `develop`, PRs to `develop`, manual
- **Purpose:** Deploy and test changes in staging environment
- **Scope:** Limited to develop branch workflow
- **Dependencies:** Relies on security validation passing

### 🎯 Production Deployment (`production-deployment.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to `main`, manual (with emergency skip option)
- **Purpose:** Deploy validated changes to production
- **Scope:** Production-ready releases only

### 🏗️ Build Pipeline Container (`build-and-deploy.yml`)
**Triggers:** Schedule (twice daily), manual
- **Purpose:** Automated content generation and site builds
- **Scope:** Content pipeline operations

## Changes Made

### ✅ Improvements
1. **Eliminated Redundant Checkov Workflow**
   - `checkov.yml` → `checkov.yml.disabled`
   - Checkov now runs as part of comprehensive security validation

2. **Enhanced Security Coverage**
   - Security validation now runs on ALL pushes (removed path restrictions)
   - Added feature branch support (`feature/*`)
   - Added weekly scheduled scans
   - Added manual trigger capability

3. **Optimized Staging Triggers**
   - Removed `feature/*` from staging deployment (unnecessary)
   - Focused staging on `develop` branch workflow
   - Maintained PR validation for develop branch

4. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Security = runs everywhere, always
   - Staging = develop branch workflow
   - Production = main branch releases
   - Content = scheduled/manual builds

## Trigger Matrix

| Event Type | Security & Cost | Staging Deploy | Production Deploy | Content Build |
|------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Push to `main` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Push to `develop` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Push to `feature/*` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| PR to `main` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| PR to `develop` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Schedule | ✅ (weekly) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (daily) |
| Manual | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Security:** Every commit gets security analysis
2. **Reduced Redundancy:** No duplicate Checkov runs
3. **Clear Workflow Progression:** feature → develop (staging) → main (production)
4. **Cost Efficiency:** Optimized triggers reduce unnecessary runs
5. **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps

- Monitor workflow runs to ensure expected behavior
- Consider adding branch protection rules requiring security validation
- Evaluate adding container security scanning for completeness
