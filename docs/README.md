## ðŸš€ Quick Navigation

### For Developers
Start with [`QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`](QUICK_START_GUIDE.md), then review:
- [`development/CONTAINER_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md`](development/CONTAINER_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md)
- [`DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md`](DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md)
- [`development/testing-guide.md`](development/testing-guide.md)

### For DevOps
Review CI/CD and infrastructure documentation:
- [`cicd/GITHUB_ACTIONS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`](cicd/GITHUB_ACTIONS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- [`infrastructure/deployment-guide.md`](infrastructure/deployment-guide.md)
- [`infrastructure/AZURE_OPENAI_SETUP.md`](infrastructure/AZURE_OPENAI_SETUP.md)

### For Security

- [`security/SECURITY_TOOLS_RATIONALE.md`](security/SECURITY_TOOLS_RATIONALE.md)

## ðŸ“‹ Current Status

The project has completed major dependency standardization and security remediation efforts. All containers now use consistent versioning with compatible release specifiers (`~=`) and separated production/test dependencies.

For the latest project status, see:
- [`VERSION_STANDARDIZATION_SUMMARY.md`](VERSION_STANDARDIZATION_SUMMARY.md)
- [`CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`](CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md)

## ðŸ”§ Maintenance

This documentation is actively maintained. When adding new documentation:
1. Place files in the appropriate category folder
2. Update this README with links to new files
3. Follow the established naming conventions
4. Include appropriate cross-references
3. **[testing-guide.md](testing-guide.md)** - Ensure quality through testing

### Production Deployment
1. **[deployment-guide.md](deployment-guide.md)** - Deploy to Azure
2. **[security-policy.md](security-policy.md)** - Security checklist
3. **[cost-analysis.md](cost-analysis.md)** - Monitor costs

## ðŸ“‹ Documentation Standards

- All documentation follows Markdown standards
- Architecture decisions are documented in SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Code examples are tested and validated  
- Documentation is updated with each major system change
- New features require corresponding documentation updates

## ðŸ”„ Maintenance

This documentation is actively maintained and reflects the current state of the system. When making system changes:

1. Update relevant documentation
2. Validate code examples still work
3. Update the IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md progress
4. Consider if SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md needs updates
