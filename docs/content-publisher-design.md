## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **ContentPublisher Function Architecture**
```python
# functions/ContentPublisher/publisher_core.py

def generate_article_content(enriched_topic: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Generate SEO-optimized article from enriched topic data."""
    
    # Extract key information
    title = optimize_title_for_seo(enriched_topic['title'])
    
    # Build article sections
    sections = {
        'tldr': generate_executive_summary(enriched_topic),
        'story': extract_core_narrative(enriched_topic),
        'perspectives': compile_multiple_viewpoints(enriched_topic),
        'analysis': generate_why_it_matters(enriched_topic),
        'verification': format_source_verification(enriched_topic),
        'future': predict_what_to_watch(enriched_topic),
        'explore': create_discovery_links(enriched_topic)
    }
    
    # Generate SEO metadata
    metadata = generate_seo_frontmatter(enriched_topic, sections)
    
    return {
        'metadata': metadata,
        'content': sections,
        'quality_metrics': assess_article_quality(sections),
        'publication_ready': validate_publication_standards(sections)
    }
```

### **Multi-Platform Citation Handling**
```python
def format_source_citations(enriched_topic: Dict) -> List[Dict]:
    """Format citations for multi-platform sources."""
    
    citations = []
    
    # Reddit discussion citation
    reddit_citation = {
        'type': 'community_discussion',
        'platform': 'reddit',
        'title': f"r/{topic['subreddit']} discussion",
        'engagement': f"{topic['score']} upvotes, {topic['num_comments']} comments",
        'url': topic['reddit_url'],
        'credibility_note': 'Community perspectives and reactions'
    }
    
    # External source citations  
    for source in enriched_topic['multi_source_recommendations']['related_sources']:
        citation = {
            'type': 'news_analysis',
            'platform': 'web',
            'domain': source['domain'],
            'credibility_score': source['credibility_score'],
            'verification_status': 'fact_checked',
            'search_query': source['search_query']
        }
        citations.append(citation)
    
    return citations
```
