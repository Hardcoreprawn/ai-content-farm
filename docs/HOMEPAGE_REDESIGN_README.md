## FAQ

**Q: Will this break anything?**  
A: No - these are purely template and CSS changes. No data modifications.

**Q: How long will it take?**  
A: Implementation: 20 min | Testing: 30 min | Deployment: 5 min

**Q: Can users still find old articles?**  
A: Yes - they're on pages 2, 3, 4, etc. Tags and search still work.

**Q: What if there's a problem?**  
A: Rollback in 5 minutes: `git revert <commit-hash>`

**Q: Will Google penalize pagination?**  
A: No - Google prefers pagination over infinite scroll. Better SEO.
