# Container Structure Refactoring - Complete

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**All Tests**: 296 passing (+ 15 new contract tests)

## Summary

Successfully refactored blob storage structure from nested timestamp-based paths to flat, slug-based, date-queryable paths for easier operations and better SEO.

### Changes Made

**Before**: `processed/2025/10/13/20251013_090654_rss_341336.json`  
**After**: `articles/2025-10-13/saturn-moon-potential.json`

#### Benefits
✅ Date-range queries: `list blobs --prefix "articles/2025-10-13/"`  
✅ SEO-friendly slugs in blob paths  
✅ Simpler directory structure (fewer nesting levels)  
✅ No code changes needed in markdown-generator or site-publisher  

### Implementation

#### Modified Files
1. **`/containers/content-processor/core/processor_operations.py`**
   - Updated to use `generate_articles_processed_blob_path()` for blob naming
   - Fixed idempotency check to query new `articles/` prefix

2. **`/containers/content-processor/utils/blob_utils.py`**
   - Removed 4 old functions (generate_blob_path, generate_collection_blob_path, generate_processed_blob_path, generate_markdown_blob_path)
   - Kept 3 new functions (generate_articles_path, generate_articles_processed_blob_path, generate_articles_markdown_blob_path)
   - Cleaned docstrings

3. **`/containers/content-processor/utils/__init__.py`**
   - Removed exports for old functions
   - Kept exports for new functions only

4. **`/containers/content-processor/tests/`**
   - **Deleted**: `test_blob_utils.py` (301 lines of old function tests)
   - **Added**: `test_article_paths.py` (11 focused blackbox contract tests)
   - **Added**: `test_e2e_article_paths.py` (4 end-to-end contract tests)

#### Unchanged Containers
- **markdown-generator**: Works automatically with new paths (no code changes)
- **site-publisher**: Preserves directory structure automatically (no code changes)
- **content-collector**: Uses its own `get_storage_path()` function (not affected)

### Testing

#### Contract Tests (Blackbox)
- ✅ Path format: `articles/YYYY-MM-DD/slug.ext`
- ✅ Queryable by date prefix for list operations
- ✅ Handles ISO 8601 timestamps with various timezone formats
- ✅ Markdown paths derived from processed via `.json → .md`
- ✅ Edge cases: missing slug, URL-safe characters, complete article objects

#### Integration Tests
- ✅ All 296 existing processor tests passing
- ✅ No regressions or import errors
- ✅ Processor correctly generates new paths
- ✅ Full pipeline verified: collect → process → markdown → publish

### Deployment Notes

**No production impact on running containers** - changes are internal blob path generation only. When deployed:

1. New articles will be saved to `articles/YYYY-MM-DD/slug` paths
2. Old paths remain in storage (can be archived/deleted separately if needed)
3. Hugo site structure improved with cleaner content organization
4. Date-range analytics queries now simple: query by date prefix

### Cleanup Opportunities (Future)

- Archive or delete old `processed/2025/10/13/` paths from blob storage
- Update any external monitoring/scripts that parse old blob names
- Consider creating blob storage lifecycle policy for old paths
