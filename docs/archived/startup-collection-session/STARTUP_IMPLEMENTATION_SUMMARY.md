# Implementation Summary: Startup Collection Pattern

## What Was Done

### 1. Modified `main.py` - Startup Collection Logic
Added startup collection to the `lifespan()` context manager that:
- Checks `AUTO_COLLECT_ON_STARTUP` environment variable (defaults to `true`)
- If enabled, runs collection on container startup using `stream_collection()` orchestrator
- Collects from configured sources (currently Mastodon instances)
- Sends valid items to the processor queue
- Logs statistics (collected, published, rejected_quality, rejected_dedup)
- Gracefully handles errors without crashing the container
- Allows FastAPI HTTP server to continue running for manual triggers

**Key implementation details:**
- Collection ID format: `keda_YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`
- Blob path: `collections/keda/{collection_id}.json`
- Queue name: `content-processor-requests`
- Error handling: Catches exceptions, logs them, continues to serve HTTP API
- Graceful shutdown: Logs shutdown message in finally block

### 2. Created `test_startup_collection.py` - 25 Test Cases
Comprehensive test coverage including:

**Core Functionality (15 tests)**
- Environment variable handling (enabled/disabled, case-insensitive)
- Collection ID format validation (`keda_` prefix + ISO timestamp)
- Blob path format validation
- Configured sources verification (without hardcoding specific sources)
- Error handling (doesn't crash container)
- Statistics logging (all fields present and valid)
- Queue name verification
- Async generator pattern usage
- HTTP server availability after collection
- Graceful shutdown verification

**Integration Tests (6 tests)**
- Mocked Azure client initialization
- Initialization order verification
- Disabled flag behavior
- Stats field completeness
- Non-negative integer validation
- Published items ≤ collected items constraint

**Edge Cases (4 tests)**
- Zero items collected
- All items rejected for quality
- All items detected as duplicates
- Mixed rejection types
- Collection ID uniqueness

## How It Works

### KEDA Cron Schedule Integration
```
00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC (daily)
       ↓
KEDA scales container 0 → 1 replica
       ↓
Container starts
       ↓
lifespan() runs startup collection
       ↓
collect_mastodon() → stream_collection() → blob + queue
       ↓
HTTP server ready for manual triggers
       ↓
After ~30 min cooldown, KEDA scales 1 → 0
```

### Sources
- **Mastodon**: fosstodon.org (25 items), techhub.social (15 items)
- **Reddit**: Disabled pending OAuth implementation
- **Template**: quality-tech.json (substantive technical content)

### Flow
```
Collection → Quality Review → Deduplication → Blob Storage + Queue
    ↓             ↓                  ↓               ↓
  Items        Filter low      Check 14-day    Save to Azure
  from         quality         window          Blob + Queue to
  sources                                       Processor
```

## Test Results

**All tests passing:**
- 248 existing tests: ✅ PASS
- 25 new startup collection tests: ✅ PASS
- **Total: 273 tests PASS**

**Test coverage:**
- Environment variable handling
- Collection ID/blob path formats
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Statistics tracking and validation
- Edge cases (zero items, all rejected, etc.)
- Integration with mocked Azure clients

## Deployment Readiness

✅ **Code**
- Modified main.py with startup collection logic
- Full error handling and logging
- Async/await implementation
- Tested with 25 new test cases

✅ **Configuration**
- AUTO_COLLECT_ON_STARTUP environment variable (defaults to true)
- Can be disabled with AUTO_COLLECT_ON_STARTUP=false
- Uses existing queue and collection infrastructure

✅ **Testing**
- 273/273 tests passing
- Coverage includes normal operation, errors, and edge cases
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Commit changes** to feature branch
2. **Push to GitHub** for CI/CD pipeline
3. **GitHub Actions** runs: security scan → tests → build → deploy
4. **Merge to main** after approval
5. **Container deployed** to production
6. **Monitor first collection** at next scheduled time (KEDA cron)
7. **Verify** blob storage and processor queue receive items
8. **Check published articles** appear in published-content container

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:
```bash
# Disable startup collection (keep HTTP triggers)
AUTO_COLLECT_ON_STARTUP=false
```

No code changes needed - container continues to serve manual HTTP triggers.

## Cost Impact

**None** - Same as alternatives (~$0.04/month):
- Collection runs 3x/day (0, 8, 16 UTC)
- ~30 seconds per run
- Minimal CPU/memory consumption
- Stays within free tier

## Benefits

✅ **Consistency**: All 4 containers use Container Apps (same managed identity)
✅ **Reliability**: Startup collection runs atomically with container lifecycle
✅ **Simplicity**: No new Azure services (stays within Container Apps)
✅ **Flexibility**: Can disable with environment variable
✅ **Observable**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
✅ **Proven**: Restores pattern you successfully used before
✅ **Tested**: 25 new test cases covering normal and edge cases
