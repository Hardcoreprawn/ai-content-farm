## Security & Cost Analysis Issues

### Issue 1: Checkov Security Scan Configuration
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Needs Fix  
**Labels**: infrastructure, security

**Description**: Checkov security scanning is failing in the current setup and needs configuration fixes.

**Problem**:
- Checkov scan exits with errors during `make security-scan`
- Security validation pipeline is incomplete without working Checkov

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Checkov runs successfully against Terraform infrastructure
- [ ] Checkov scan integrates properly with make security-scan
- [ ] Security scan completes without errors
- [ ] Fix any high/critical security issues found

**Files to Modify**:
- `/infra/*.tf` (Terraform configurations)
- `Makefile` (security-scan target)
- Potentially `.checkov.yml` for configuration

### Issue 2: Infracost API Key Configuration
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Needs Fix  
**Labels**: infrastructure, cost-analysis

**Description**: Infracost cost estimation requires API key configuration for proper cost analysis.

**Problem**:
- `INFRACOST_API_KEY` environment variable not set
- Cost estimation pipeline fails without API key
- Unable to run `make cost-estimate` successfully

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Set up Infracost API key in development environment
- [ ] Configure cost estimation in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Document API key setup process
- [ ] Cost estimates work for all infrastructure changes

**Files to Modify**:
- `.env.example` (document required environment variables)
- `Makefile` (cost-estimate target)
- Documentation for setup process

### Issue 3: Container Import Paths
**Priority**: Low  
**Status**: Partial Fix Applied  
**Labels**: containers, development

**Description**: Some containers still have issues importing the shared `libs` package.

**Problem**:
- `collector-scheduler` and `content-generator` containers restarting
- Import errors for shared libraries in some contexts

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All containers import `libs` successfully
- [ ] No container restart loops
- [ ] Consistent import patterns across all services

**Status**: Partially resolved with sys.path fixes, monitoring required.
