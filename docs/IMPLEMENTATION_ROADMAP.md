# Implementation Roadmap

This document provides a concrete, step-by-step plan for implementing the standardized, event-driven AI Content Farm architecture.

## Current Status Assessment

### Working Components ✅

- Non-standard API structures across containers
- Filesystem-based operations instead of blob storage
- Missing event-driven triggers
- Inconsistent error handling and logging

### Missing Components ❌
- Standardized container implementations
- Production-ready health checks
- Inter-service communication patterns
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Automated deployment workflows

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Blob storage integration complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple operations, add complexity gradually
   - Fallback: Keep filesystem backup for development

2. **Service communication reliability**
   - Mitigation: Implement retries and circuit breakers
   - Fallback: Manual trigger endpoints for debugging

3. **Performance degradation**
   - Mitigation: Continuous performance monitoring
   - Fallback: Optimize critical paths first

### Contingency Plans

#### If SSG migration fails:
1. Revert to filesystem-based operation temporarily
2. Implement blob storage gradually
3. Focus on getting basic site generation working first

#### If event-driven architecture is complex:
1. Start with HTTP-based service communication
2. Add blob storage watching as enhancement
3. Implement manual trigger endpoints as backup

#### If performance is inadequate:
1. Profile and optimize critical paths
2. Implement caching where appropriate
3. Consider parallel processing for content operations

## Implementation Notes

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure development environment is ready

```

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Run tests after each major change
pytest containers/{container}/tests/          # Unit tests
pytest tests/test_integration.py             # Integration tests
./test-pipeline.sh                          # End-to-end tests
```

### Documentation Updates
- Update SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md with each major change
- Keep API documentation current
- Update deployment guides as needed

This roadmap provides the structure and accountability needed to transform the AI Content Farm into a production-ready, event-driven system while maintaining development momentum and delivering user value.
