# Scheduler Implementation Roadmap

## Implementation Phases

### üöÄ Phase 1: MVP Scheduler (Week 1)
**Goal**: Basic working scheduler calling content-collector on fixed intervals

#### Tasks
- [ ] **Infrastructure Setup**
  - [ ] Add Logic App Terraform resources (`infra/scheduler.tf`)
  - [ ] Configure managed identity and RBAC permissions
  - [ ] Create Azure Table Storage for topic configuration
  - [ ] Deploy initial infrastructure

- [ ] **Basic Logic App Workflow**
  - [ ] Simple recurrence trigger (every 4 hours)
  - [ ] Managed Identity authentication to content-collector
  - [ ] Single topic collection (Technology)
  - [ ] Basic error handling and logging

- [ ] **Topic Configuration**
  - [ ] Create initial topic configuration in Azure Table Storage
  - [ ] Technology topic with 3-4 subreddits
  - [ ] Basic collection parameters (limit, min_score, etc.)

- [ ] **Testing & Validation**
  - [ ] Test Logic App triggers content-collector successfully
  - [ ] Verify managed identity authentication works
  - [ ] Confirm content flows through to content-processor
  - [ ] Monitor costs and execution frequency

### ‚ö° Phase 3: Advanced Orchestration (Week 4+)
**Goal**: Intelligent scheduling with source discovery and optimization

#### Tasks
- [ ] **Source Discovery Engine**
  - [ ] Analyze successful content to identify high-value sources
  - [ ] Cross-reference topics to find overlapping subreddits
  - [ ] Automatically suggest new sources based on content quality
  - [ ] A/B test new sources before adding to regular schedule

- [ ] **Adaptive Scheduling**
  - [ ] Machine learning-based frequency optimization
  - [ ] Time-of-day optimization based on content availability
  - [ ] Seasonal adjustments for topic relevance
  - [ ] Load balancing to avoid rate limiting

- [ ] **Cross-Platform Preparation**
  - [ ] Extend topic configuration for multiple source types
  - [ ] Prepare framework for Bluesky/Mastodon integration
  - [ ] RSS feed integration via scheduler
  - [ ] Web scraping schedule coordination

- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**
  - [ ] Content performance correlation (collection ‚Üí website traffic)
  - [ ] ROI analysis (collection cost vs content value)
  - [ ] Predictive scheduling based on historical patterns
  - [ ] Source quality scoring and ranking

#### Success Criteria
- Scheduler automatically discovers 2+ new valuable sources monthly
- Content quality scores improve by 20% through better source selection
- Collection costs reduce by 30% through optimized scheduling
- Cross-posting intelligence identifies content overlap > 80% accuracy
