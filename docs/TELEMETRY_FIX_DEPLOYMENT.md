# Telemetry Fix Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Issue**: No telemetry data appearing in Log Analytics despite infrastructure setup  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED - Ready for deployment**

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The `azure-monitor-opentelemetry` package was **missing from container requirements** while the code was trying to use it. This caused silent failure at startup:

```python
# At container startup:
try:
    from azure.monitor.opentelemetry import configure_azure_monitor
except ImportError:
    logger.warning("...")  # ‚Üê SILENTLY DISABLED
    return None
```

**Result**: No telemetry sent to Log Analytics, but no obvious error to alert developers.

### Evidence
1. ‚úÖ Log Analytics workspace configured correctly
2. ‚úÖ Application Insights created and linked
3. ‚úÖ Connection string in container environment variables
4. ‚ùå Missing dependency in container build process
5. ‚ùå Silent failure at startup (warning only)

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Missing Dependencies ‚úÖ

**File**: `/workspaces/ai-content-farm/containers/content-collector/requirements.txt`
```diff
+ azure-monitor-opentelemetry~=1.6.4  # Application Insights integration
```

**File**: `/workspaces/ai-content-farm/containers/content-processor/requirements.txt`
```diff
+ azure-monitor-opentelemetry~=1.6.4  # Application Insights integration
```

**File**: `/workspaces/ai-content-farm/containers/markdown-generator/requirements.txt`
```diff
+ azure-monitor-opentelemetry~=1.6.4  # Application Insights integration
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Diagnostics ‚úÖ

**File**: `/workspaces/ai-content-farm/libs/monitoring/appinsights.py`

**Before**:
```python
except ImportError as e:
    logger.warning(
        f"Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry not installed: {e} - monitoring disabled"
    )
    return None
```

**After**:
```python
except ImportError as e:
    logger.error(
        f"""

‚ïë                  TELEMETRY DISABLED - CRITICAL                  ‚ïë
‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù
Missing required package for Application Insights monitoring:
  Error: {e}

To fix:
  1. Install: pip install azure-monitor-opentelemetry~=1.6.4
  2. Rebuild container image
  3. Redeploy container application
        """
    )
    return None
```

### 3. Added Verification Script ‚úÖ

**File**: `/workspaces/ai-content-farm/scripts/verify-telemetry.sh`

Comprehensive verification that:
- Log Analytics workspace exists and is accessible
- Application Insights is linked
- Telemetry data is flowing into Log Analytics
- Container environment variables are set correctly
- Queries recent custom events, traces, and exceptions

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Rebuild Containers
The changes to `requirements.txt` will trigger automatic rebuild on next deployment:

```bash
# Push changes to trigger GitHub Actions
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(telemetry): Add missing azure-monitor-opentelemetry dependency

- Added azure-monitor-opentelemetry~=1.6.4 to all container requirements
- Enhanced error logging to clearly indicate when telemetry is disabled
- Added verify-telemetry.sh script for diagnostics

This fixes the silent telemetry failure where containers weren't sending
data to Application Insights due to missing dependency."

git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Monitor CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions will:
1. Rebuild all containers with new dependencies
2. Run tests (all should pass)
3. Push to container registry
4. Update Azure Container Apps

Expected duration: 5-15 minutes

### Step 3: Verify Telemetry
After deployment completes (allow 2-3 minutes for data to flow):

```bash
# Quick verification
scripts/verify-telemetry.sh

# Or with custom parameters
scripts/verify-telemetry.sh ai-content-prod-rg ai-content-prod-la ai-content-prod-insights
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### ‚úÖ Immediate (at container startup)
```log
[INFO] Application Insights configured (minimal instrumentation) for: content-collector
[INFO] Application Insights configured (minimal instrumentation) for: content-processor
[INFO] Application Insights configured (minimal instrumentation) for: site-generator
```

### ‚úÖ Within 2-5 minutes (data ingestion)
Data appears in Log Analytics:
- Custom events from application code
- FastAPI request traces
- Exception information
- Performance metrics

### ‚úÖ Available in Log Analytics
```kql
// View custom events
customEvents
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| project name, customDimensions, timestamp

// View application performance
requests
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| summarize count(), avg(duration) by name

// View errors
exceptions
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| summarize count() by outerMessage
```

## Verification Commands

### Check Dependencies
```bash
# Verify all containers have the dependency
grep azure-monitor-opentelemetry containers/*/requirements.txt
```

### Verify Package Installed
```bash
# After deployment, check container has package
az exec -n ai-content-prod-collector -c content-collector \
  -- python -c "from azure.monitor.opentelemetry import configure_azure_monitor; print('OK')"
```

### Query Telemetry
```bash
# View latest custom events
az monitor log-analytics query \
  --workspace ai-content-prod-la \
  --analytics-query "customEvents | top 10 by timestamp desc"

# View application performance
az monitor log-analytics query \
  --workspace ai-content-prod-la \
  --analytics-query "requests | summarize count() by name, resultCode"
```

## Files Modified

| File | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| `containers/content-collector/requirements.txt` | Added dependency | Enables telemetry collection |
| `containers/content-processor/requirements.txt` | Added dependency | Enables telemetry collection |
| `containers/markdown-generator/requirements.txt` | Added dependency | Enables telemetry collection |
| `libs/monitoring/appinsights.py` | Enhanced logging | Better diagnostics |
| `scripts/verify-telemetry.sh` | New script | Verification & monitoring |

## Why This Happened

1. **Initial Setup**: Telemetry configured in code ‚úÖ
2. **Infrastructure**: Log Analytics and App Insights created ‚úÖ
3. **Environment Variables**: Connection strings set in containers ‚úÖ
4. **Missing Piece**: Dependency not added to container build üòû
5. **Silent Failure**: Code caught ImportError and silently disabled ü§´

## Prevention

To prevent this in future:
1. ‚úÖ Test locally first: Containers should be built locally and tested
2. ‚úÖ Add tests to verify telemetry initialization
3. ‚úÖ Monitor logs for telemetry warnings (now fixed)
4. ‚úÖ Regular verification script checks (now available)

## Rollback (if needed)

If there are any issues after deployment:

```bash
# Revert changes
git revert HEAD~1

# Push to trigger rebuild without telemetry
git push origin main
```

The system will continue to work, just without Application Insights telemetry.

## Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| T+0s | Push changes to GitHub |
| T+30s | GitHub Actions starts building |
| T+5m | Containers rebuilt with new dependency |
| T+8m | Tests run |
| T+10m | Containers pushed to registry |
| T+12m | Azure Container Apps updated |
| T+15m | Containers restart with new image |
| T+18m | First telemetry events arrive |
| T+20m | Data visible in Log Analytics |

## Monitoring Dashboard Setup (Optional)

To make telemetry more visible, you can:

1. **Create saved queries** in Log Analytics for frequent checks:
   ```kql
   customEvents | top 100 by timestamp desc
   exceptions | summarize count() by outerMessage
   requests | summarize count() by resultCode
   ```

2. **Create Azure Dashboard** pinning queries for team visibility

3. **Set up alerts** for errors or high latency

See `docs/DASHBOARD_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Review changes (complete)
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è Push to GitHub to trigger CI/CD
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Monitor GitHub Actions for build completion
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Allow 2-3 minutes for telemetry data to flow
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Run `scripts/verify-telemetry.sh` to confirm
6. ‚è≠Ô∏è Create team dashboard for ongoing monitoring

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for production deployment  
**Risk Level**: Low - only adding missing dependency, no breaking changes  
**Rollback**: Simple - revert commit if needed  
**Estimated Fix Time**: 15-20 minutes (including deployment)
