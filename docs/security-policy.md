# Security and Cost Governance Policy

**Created:** August 5, 2025  
**Last Updated:** August 5, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the security, compliance, and cost governance controls implemented in the AI Content Farm project to prevent security misconfigurations, ensure compliance, and manage costs effectively.

## 🛡️ Security Scanning Pipeline

### Pre-Deployment Security Checks

All infrastructure and application code is scanned before deployment using multiple security tools:

#### 1. Checkov - Infrastructure as Code Security
- **Purpose**: Scans Terraform configurations for security misconfigurations
- **Scope**: All files in `infra/` and `azure-function-deploy/`
- **Output**: JSON results with detailed findings stored in `infra/checkov-results.json`
- **Blocking**: Critical/High severity issues block deployment
- **Current Status**: ✅ 23/23 checks passing

#### 2. TFSec - Terraform Security Scanner
- **Purpose**: Static analysis of Terraform for security issues
- **Scope**: All `.tf` files in `infra/`
- **Output**: JSON results with security findings stored in `infra/tfsec-results.json`
- **Blocking**: Critical/High severity issues block deployment
- **Integration**: Transitioning to Trivy for enhanced capabilities

#### 3. Terrascan - Policy-as-Code Scanner
- **Purpose**: Compliance and security policy validation
- **Scope**: Terraform configurations
- **Output**: JSON results with policy violations stored in `infra/terrascan-results.json`
- **Monitoring**: Results tracked for compliance reporting
- **Focus**: Azure security best practices and regulatory compliance

### Security Score Requirements

#### Staging Environment
- **High Severity**: Warnings logged, deployment proceeds
- **Critical Severity**: Manual review required
- **Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of security trends

#### Production Environment
- **High Severity**: Deployment blocked until resolved
- **Critical Severity**: Immediate deployment halt
- **Compliance**: Zero tolerance for critical security issues

### Current Security Status
- **Checkov**: 23 checks passed, 0 failed ✅
- **TFSec**: Infrastructure security validated ✅
- **Terrascan**: Policy compliance verified ✅
- **Key Vault**: HIGH severity logging issue resolved ✅

## 🔐 Key Vault Security Controls

### Secret Management
- **Centralized Storage**: All sensitive credentials in Azure Key Vault
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate Key Vaults for dev/staging/production
- **Access Control**: Least privilege access policies
- **Audit Logging**: Full diagnostic logging enabled for compliance

### Secret Security Standards
- **Content Type**: All secrets have explicit content type specification
- **Expiration**: Automatic expiration after 1 year for rotation
- **Access Policies**: Function Apps (read-only), CI/CD (management)
- **Encryption**: Microsoft-managed encryption at rest and in transit

### Compliance Features
- **Audit Trail**: Complete access logging to Azure Monitor
- **Access Reviews**: Regular review of Key Vault access policies
- **Secret Rotation**: Built-in expiration for automatic rotation
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for each role

## 💰 Cost Governance

### Cost Estimation and Control

#### Infracost Integration
- **Purpose**: Estimate infrastructure costs before deployment
- **Scope**: All Terraform configurations
- **Output**: Detailed cost breakdown with monthly estimates
- **Alerts**: Warnings for significant cost increases

#### Cost Control Measures
- **Function Apps**: Consumption plan for pay-per-execution
- **Storage**: Lifecycle policies for automatic tier movement
- **Key Vault**: Standard tier optimization
- **Monitoring**: Retention policies to control log storage costs

### Budget Monitoring
```bash
# Generate cost estimate
make cost-estimate

# Review monthly cost projection
cat infra/infracost-report.json

# Monitor actual vs estimated costs
az consumption budget list --resource-group "ai-content-farm-prod"
```

## 📋 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

### SBOM Generation
- **Tool**: Syft for comprehensive dependency scanning
- **Scope**: Python packages, Node.js dependencies, container images
- **Format**: SPDX and CycloneDX formats supported
- **Storage**: SBOM artifacts stored with each release

### Dependency Security
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scans of all dependencies
- **License Compliance**: Tracking of open source licenses
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verification of package integrity
- **Update Monitoring**: Automated alerts for security updates

### SBOM Workflow
```bash
# Generate SBOM for Python components
syft packages dir:functions -o spdx-json=sbom-functions.json

# Generate SBOM for Node.js components  
syft packages dir:site -o spdx-json=sbom-site.json

# Combine and analyze SBOMs
make generate-sbom
```

## 🔍 Continuous Monitoring

### Security Monitoring
- **Application Insights**: Function execution and error monitoring
- **Key Vault Diagnostics**: Secret access pattern analysis
- **Azure Monitor**: Resource utilization and security alerts
- **GitHub Security**: Dependabot alerts and security advisories

### Compliance Monitoring
- **Policy Compliance**: Regular Terrascan policy validation
- **Configuration Drift**: Monitoring for infrastructure changes
- **Access Reviews**: Quarterly review of permissions and access
- **Audit Reports**: Monthly security and compliance summaries

### Alerting Strategy
```bash
# Security alerts
- High severity findings in security scans
- Unusual Key Vault access patterns
- Function authentication failures
- Dependency vulnerabilities

# Cost alerts  
- Monthly spend exceeding 120% of estimate
- Unexpected resource provisioning
- Storage growth beyond projections
```

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Security Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated alerts trigger incident workflow
2. **Assessment**: Rapid evaluation of impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Immediate mitigation steps
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis and evidence collection
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and validation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements

### Breach Response Procedures
- **Key Rotation**: Immediate rotation of potentially compromised keys
- **Access Revocation**: Temporary suspension of suspicious access
- **Audit Review**: Comprehensive review of access logs
- **Notification**: Stakeholder communication per compliance requirements

## 📊 Governance Reporting

### Security Metrics
- **Security Scan Results**: Pass/fail rates by tool and severity
- **Key Vault Access**: Patterns and anomaly detection
- **Vulnerability Counts**: Open vulnerabilities by severity and age
- **Compliance Score**: Overall security posture rating

### Cost Metrics
- **Monthly Spend**: Actual vs projected costs
- **Resource Utilization**: Efficiency metrics for each service
- **Cost Trends**: Historical spending analysis
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Recommendations for cost reduction

### Compliance Reporting
```bash
# Generate security summary
make security-scan > reports/security-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt

# Generate cost report
infracost breakdown --path=infra > reports/cost-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json

# Generate SBOM report
make generate-sbom > reports/sbom-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json
```
