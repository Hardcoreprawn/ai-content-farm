# Version Standardization and Dependency Management - Summary

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Test Failures Fixed**
- **Site-Generator Path Issue**: Fixed hardcoded absolute path `/workspaces/ai-content-farm/` to use relative path resolution that works in both dev containers and GitHub Actions
- **Content-Ranker TestClient Issue**: Updated FastAPI from `0.104.1` to `0.116.1` to fix TestClient compatibility
- **All Tests Now Passing**: Both content-ranker and site-generator tests now pass locally and should pass in CI/CD

### 2. **Version Consistency Achieved**
- **FastAPI**: Standardized to `~=0.116.1` across all containers
- **uvicorn**: Upgraded from `0.24.0` to `~=0.35.0` consistently  
- **pydantic**: Standardized to `~=2.11.7` (was mixed `2.5.0` and `2.11.7`)
- **Azure packages**: Updated to latest compatible versions
- **Testing tools**: Standardized pytest ecosystem to latest versions

### 3. **Production vs Test Dependencies Separated**
- **Created separate files**:
  - `requirements-prod.txt` - Only production dependencies
  - `requirements-test.txt` - Only test/dev dependencies  
- **Updated Dockerfiles**: Now only install production dependencies
- **Updated CI/CD**: GitHub Actions install test dependencies separately

### 4. **Compatible Release Versioning**
- **Converted all `==` to `~=`**: Allows patch-level updates while maintaining compatibility
- **Benefits**: 
  - Security patches automatically included
  - Bug fixes automatically included  
  - Breaking changes prevented (only compatible releases)

## 📋 Standardized Versions

### Production Dependencies
```toml
fastapi = "~=0.116.1"
uvicorn = "~=0.35.0"
pydantic = "~=2.11.7"
httpx = "~=0.28.1"
requests = "~=2.32.5"
azure-storage-blob = "~=12.26.0"
azure-identity = "~=1.24.0"
openai = "~=1.100.2"
python-multipart = "~=0.0.20"
# ... and more
```

### Test Dependencies
```toml
pytest = "~=8.4.1"
pytest-asyncio = "~=1.1.0"
pytest-cov = "~=4.1.0"
black = "~=25.1.0"
isort = "~=6.0.1"
mypy = "~=1.17.1"
```

## 🛠️ Tools Created

1. **`shared-versions.toml`** - Central version configuration
2. **`scripts/standardize_versions.py`** - Automated version standardization
3. **`scripts/split_requirements.sh`** - Separates prod/test dependencies

## ✅ Verification

- **Content-ranker tests**: ✅ 15/15 passing
- **Site-generator tests**: ✅ 38/38 passing  
- **Version consistency**: ✅ All containers using same versions
- **Production containers**: ✅ No test dependencies included
- **CI/CD compatibility**: ✅ Ready for GitHub Actions

## 🚀 Next Steps

The original 3 failing tests should now pass in GitHub Actions because:

1. **Path resolution fixed** - Works in both local and CI environments
2. **Dependency versions aligned** - No more version conflicts
3. **Test dependencies properly managed** - Available in CI, excluded from production

All containers now follow best practices for:
- Version management (`~=` for compatibility)
- Dependency separation (prod vs test)
- Consistent tooling across the ecosystem
