  - Router initialization and configuration
  - Message processing logic with proper JSON handling
  - Service Bus status retrieval
  - Error handling for failed messages
  - HTTP endpoint registration
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **23 tests passing**

### 2. Service Bus Coverage Tests (`tests/test_service_bus_coverage.py`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive coverage testing for Service Bus infrastructure
- **Coverage**:
  - End-to-end message processing flow
  - Error handling with invalid JSON messages
  - Mock implementations for content collector, processor, and site generator
  - Service Bus client initialization and status checking

- **Status**: ‚úÖ **12 tests passing**

### 3. Integration Tests (`tests/test_integration_pipeline.py`)
- **Purpose**: Test interaction between services via Service Bus messaging
- **Coverage**:
  - Content collection to processing flow
  - Processing to site generation flow
  - Cross-service router communication
  - Error handling across service boundaries
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **4 passing, 3 failing (import issues), 1 error**
- **Note**: Integration tests require container module path resolution fixes

### 4. Functional Tests (`tests/test_functional_pipeline.py`)
- **Purpose**: End-to-end testing against deployed services
- **Coverage**:
  - Service health checks for all containers
  - Complete pipeline validation from collection to publication
  - Performance baseline testing
  - Service Bus integration verification
- **Status**: üìã **Framework ready** (requires deployed services to run)

### 5. Container-Specific Tests
- **Content Processor**: ‚úÖ **35 passing, 1 failing** (authentication issue)
- **Site Generator**: ‚úÖ **163 tests passing** (excellent coverage)
- **Content Collector**: ‚úÖ **11 tests passing** (limited due to import issues)

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Runner Script (`scripts/run-tests.sh`)
```bash
# Usage examples:
./scripts/run-tests.sh unit                    # Run unit tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh container               # Run container tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh all --fast             # Run all tests quickly
./scripts/run-tests.sh coverage               # Generate coverage report
```

**Features**:
- Automated environment setup with mock configurations
- Multiple test execution modes (unit, integration, container, functional)
- Coverage reporting with HTML output
- Fast execution mode for CI/CD
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Makefile Targets
```bash
make test            # Default unit tests
make test-unit       # Unit tests only
make test-integration # Integration tests
make test-container  # Container-specific tests
make test-service-bus # Service Bus router tests
make test-functional # Functional tests (requires deployed services)
make test-all        # All tests except functional
make test-coverage   # Tests with coverage report
```

### CI/CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/test-suite.yml`)
**Multi-job pipeline**:
1. **Unit Tests Job**: Fast unit test execution with basic validation
2. **Container Tests Job**: Service-specific testing with container isolation
3. **Functional Tests Job**: End-to-end validation against deployed services
4. **Coverage Reporting**: Codecov integration for tracking test coverage

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Current Coverage Metrics
- **libs/service_bus_router.py**: 79% coverage (20/97 lines missed)
- **libs/shared_models.py**: 75% coverage (30/120 lines missed)
- **libs/service_bus_client.py**: 26% coverage (137/185 lines missed)
- **Overall Project**: 9% coverage (2916/3199 lines missed)

### Coverage Highlights
‚úÖ **Service Bus Router**: Well-tested with comprehensive unit tests
‚úÖ **Site Generator**: Excellent coverage with 163 comprehensive tests
‚úÖ **Content Processor**: Good coverage with 33 tests
‚ö†Ô∏è **Content Collector**: Limited coverage due to import path issues

## Mock and Testing Strategy

### Service Bus Mocking
```python
# Comprehensive mocking for Service Bus operations
mock_client = AsyncMock(spec=ServiceBusClient)
mock_client.receive_messages.return_value = [mock_message]
mock_client.complete_message = AsyncMock()
mock_client.abandon_message = AsyncMock()
```

### Environment Isolation
```bash
# Isolated test environment with mock services
export TESTING=true
export MOCK_EXTERNAL_SERVICES=true
export SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING="mock-connection"
export BLOB_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="mock-storage"
```

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Service Bus Router Testing
- **MockServiceBusRouter**: Complete test implementation of the base router class
- **Message Processing**: Tests JSON parsing, operation handling, and error recovery
- **Status Checking**: Validates Service Bus connection status and queue monitoring

### 2. Pipeline Integration
- **Cross-Service Communication**: Tests message flow between collector ‚Üí processor ‚Üí generator
- **Error Propagation**: Validates error handling across service boundaries
- **Service Bus Routing**: Tests proper message routing and acknowledgment

### 3. Functional Testing Framework
- **Health Checks**: HTTP endpoints for service availability
- **End-to-End Validation**: Complete pipeline from content discovery to site publication
- **Performance Baselines**: Response time and throughput validation

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Fix Integration Test Imports
```bash
# Required: Fix container module imports
export PYTHONPATH="/workspaces/ai-content-farm/containers:$PYTHONPATH"
```

### 2. Deploy Services for Functional Testing
1. Deploy container services to Azure Container Apps
2. Configure Service Bus namespace and queues
3. Run functional tests against deployed infrastructure

### 3. Enable CI/CD Pipeline
1. Push changes to trigger GitHub Actions workflow
2. Monitor test execution across multiple jobs
3. Review coverage reports via Codecov integration
