# GitHub Actions Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution
Fixed GitHub Actions 403 Forbidden errors when accessing Azure Key Vault by implementing proper OIDC authentication with environment-based federated identity credentials. Additionally resolved production deployment role assignment errors by adding User Access Administrator permissions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Bootstrap Infrastructure (`infra/bootstrap/main.tf`)
- âœ… Added environment-based federated identity credentials:
  - `staging-environment`: `repo:Hardcoreprawn/ai-content-farm:environment:staging`
  - `production-environment`: `repo:Hardcoreprawn/ai-content-farm:environment:production`
- âœ… Maintained existing branch-based credentials for develop/main branches and pull requests
- âœ… **NEW (Aug 11, 2025)**: Added User Access Administrator role assignment:
  ```terraform
  resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "github_actions_user_access_admin" {
    scope                = "/subscriptions/${data.azurerm_client_config.current.subscription_id}"
    role_definition_name = "User Access Administrator"
    principal_id         = azuread_service_principal.github_actions.object_id
  }
  ```

### 2. Main Infrastructure (`infra/application/main.tf`)
- âœ… Added GitHub Actions access policy to Key Vault with minimal permissions:
  - `secret_permissions = ["Get", "List"]` only
  - Applied principle of least privilege
- âœ… Removed overly broad Key Vault Administrator role

### 3. Production Resource Naming (`infra/application/production.tfvars`)
- âœ… **NEW (Aug 11, 2025)**: Fixed resource prefix from `ai-content-prod` to `ai-content-production`
- âœ… Prevents resource recreation and Key Vault soft-delete conflicts

### 4. Pipeline Enhancements (`.github/workflows/consolidated-pipeline.yml`)
- âœ… Enhanced error handling for Infracost API key retrieval
- âœ… Improved terraform plan error diagnostics
- âœ… Added fallback mechanisms for Key Vault authentication

## Security Improvements
- **Least Privilege**: GitHub Actions now has minimal Key Vault access (Get/List secrets only)
- **OIDC Authentication**: Workload identity federation eliminates need for stored secrets
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate credentials for staging and production environments
- **Role Assignment Permissions**: Proper separation of bootstrap vs application permissions

## Permission Architecture
- **Bootstrap Terraform**: Manages foundational GitHub Actions permissions
  - Contributor role (resource management)
  - User Access Administrator role (role assignment creation)
- **Application Terraform**: Uses permissions to deploy application resources
  - Storage role assignments for function app managed identity
  - Key Vault access policies

## Authentication Flow
1. GitHub Actions uses OIDC to authenticate with Azure AD
2. Azure AD validates the federated identity credential based on:
   - Repository: `Hardcoreprawn/ai-content-farm`
   - Environment: `staging` or `production`
   - Issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
3. Azure grants access token for the GitHub Actions service principal
4. Service principal accesses Key Vault with restricted permissions
5. Service principal creates necessary role assignments during deployment

## Testing Status
- âœ… Bootstrap terraform applied successfully
- âœ… Environment credentials created
- âœ… User Access Administrator role added and imported to Terraform state
- âœ… Production resource naming conflicts resolved
- ðŸ”„ Pipeline testing in progress

## Next Steps
1. Monitor GitHub Actions pipeline execution
2. Verify successful staging deployment
3. Confirm production deployment capabilities
4. Document lessons learned for future reference

## Files Modified
- `infra/bootstrap/main.tf` - Added User Access Administrator role
- `infra/application/main.tf` - Removed incorrect role assignment placement
- `infra/application/production.tfvars` - Fixed resource prefix naming
- `.github/workflows/consolidated-pipeline.yml` - Enhanced error handling

**Date**: August 11, 2025  
**Status**: Authentication and permission fixes applied, production deployment testing in progress
