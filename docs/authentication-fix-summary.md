# GitHub Actions Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution
Fixed GitHub Actions 403 Forbidden errors when accessing Azure Key Vault by implementing proper OIDC authentication with environment-based federated identity credentials.

## Changes Made

### 1. Bootstrap Infrastructure (`infra/bootstrap/main.tf`)
- âœ… Added environment-based federated identity credentials:
  - `staging-environment`: `repo:Hardcoreprawn/ai-content-farm:environment:staging`
  - `production-environment`: `repo:Hardcoreprawn/ai-content-farm:environment:production`
- âœ… Maintained existing branch-based credentials for develop/main branches and pull requests

### 2. Main Infrastructure (`infra/main.tf`)
- âœ… Added GitHub Actions access policy to Key Vault with minimal permissions:
  - `secret_permissions = ["Get", "List"]` only
  - Applied principle of least privilege
- âœ… Removed overly broad Key Vault Administrator role

### 3. Pipeline Enhancements (`.github/workflows/consolidated-pipeline.yml`)
- âœ… Enhanced error handling for Infracost API key retrieval
- âœ… Improved terraform plan error diagnostics
- âœ… Added fallback mechanisms for Key Vault authentication

## Security Improvements
- **Least Privilege**: GitHub Actions now has minimal Key Vault access (Get/List secrets only)
- **OIDC Authentication**: Workload identity federation eliminates need for stored secrets
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate credentials for staging and production environments

## Authentication Flow
1. GitHub Actions uses OIDC to authenticate with Azure AD
2. Azure AD validates the federated identity credential based on:
   - Repository: `Hardcoreprawn/ai-content-farm`
   - Environment: `staging` or `production`
   - Issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
3. Azure grants access token for the GitHub Actions service principal
4. Service principal accesses Key Vault with restricted permissions

## Testing Status
- âœ… Bootstrap terraform applied successfully
- âœ… Environment credentials created
- ðŸ”„ Pipeline testing in progress

## Next Steps
1. Monitor GitHub Actions pipeline execution
2. Verify successful staging deployment
3. Confirm production deployment capabilities
4. Document lessons learned for future reference

## Files Modified
