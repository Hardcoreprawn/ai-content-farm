# Security Fix: Resolve CodeQL Alert #89

## Issue Description
**Alert ID**: #89
**Type**: Information exposure through an exception (py/stack-trace-exposure)
**Severity**: Medium
**Location**: `containers/content-ranker/main.py`, lines 128-133
**Risk**: Stack trace information flows to a location that may be exposed to external users

## Root Cause Analysis
The current code in the legacy health check endpoint potentially exposes sensitive information:

```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Legacy health check failed: {e}")  # Logs sensitive details (OK)
    raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail="Health check failed")  # Generic message (OK)
```

While the current implementation already uses a generic error message, CodeQL is flagging this as potentially risky because:
1. The exception object `e` is captured and could theoretically be exposed
2. Future modifications might accidentally expose the exception details

## Security Fix Implementation

### Before (Current Code)
```python
@app.get("/health")
async def legacy_health():
    """Legacy health check endpoint for backward compatibility."""
    try:
        from config import health_check

        health_data = health_check()
        return {
            "status": health_data.get("status", "healthy"),
            "service": "content-ranker",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "message": "Legacy health endpoint - use /api/content-ranker/health for standardized format",
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Legacy health check failed: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail="Health check failed")
```

### After (Secure Code)
```python
@app.get("/health")
async def legacy_health():
    """Legacy health check endpoint for backward compatibility."""
    try:
        from config import health_check

        health_data = health_check()
        return {
            "status": health_data.get("status", "healthy"),
            "service": "content-ranker",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "message": "Legacy health endpoint - use /api/content-ranker/health for standardized format",
        }
    except Exception as e:
        # Log detailed error for debugging (server-side only)
        logger.error(f"Legacy health check failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
        # Return generic error message (no sensitive information exposed)
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=503, 
            detail={
                "error": "Service temporarily unavailable",
                "message": "Health check failed - please try again later",
                "service": "content-ranker"
            }
        )
```

## Security Improvements

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Added `exc_info=True` to capture full stack trace in logs
2. **Structured Response**: Return structured error object instead of string
3. **No Sensitive Data**: Absolutely no exception details in HTTP response
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear message for external consumers
5. **Debugging Support**: Full details available in server logs

## Testing Strategy

### Security Validation
```python
def test_health_endpoint_error_handling():
    """Test that health endpoint doesn't expose sensitive information."""
    # Mock health_check to raise an exception with sensitive data
    with patch('config.health_check') as mock_health:
        mock_health.side_effect = Exception("Sensitive database password: admin123")
        
        response = client.get("/health")
        
        # Verify generic error response
        assert response.status_code == 503
        assert "Sensitive database password" not in response.text
        assert "admin123" not in response.text
        assert response.json()["error"] == "Service temporarily unavailable"
```

### Functional Testing
```python
def test_health_endpoint_success():
    """Test normal health endpoint operation."""
    with patch('config.health_check') as mock_health:
        mock_health.return_value = {"status": "healthy"}
        
        response = client.get("/health")
        
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
        assert response.json()["service"] == "content-ranker"
```

## Implementation Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Analyze Issue**: Understand CodeQL alert and security implications
2. ‚úÖ **Design Fix**: Create secure error handling pattern
3. üîÑ **Apply Fix**: Update code with secure implementation
4. ‚è≥ **Test Fix**: Validate security and functionality
5. ‚è≥ **Verify Resolution**: Confirm CodeQL alert is resolved

## Agent Automation Pattern

This fix demonstrates how a security agent would:

1. **Detect**: Automatically identify stack trace exposure issues
2. **Analyze**: Understand the specific vulnerability pattern
3. **Fix**: Apply standardized secure error handling template
4. **Test**: Validate both security and functionality
5. **Deploy**: Create PR with comprehensive testing and documentation

## Related Security Patterns

This fix can be applied to similar patterns across the codebase:
- All FastAPI exception handlers
- Health check endpoints in other containers
- Any user-facing error responses

## Compliance & Standards

This fix aligns with:
- **OWASP Top 10**: Prevents security logging and monitoring failures
- **CWE-209**: Information exposure through error messages
- **CWE-497**: Exposure of sensitive system information
- **Project Security Guidelines**: "Never log sensitive data in user responses"
