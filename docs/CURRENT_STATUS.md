## üîÑ Phase 2: READY TO BEGIN

**Priority**: Next deployment cycle  
**Target**: Complete within 2 days  
**Documentation**: See `docs/PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

### Three Quality Improvement Tasks

#### Task 1: AI Title Generation üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
- **Problem**: Titles truncated mid-word with "..." 
- **Solution**: Use Azure OpenAI to generate clean, concise titles
- **Container**: content-processor
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Cost**: ~$0.10/1000 articles

**Ready to implement**: All design complete, Azure OpenAI already integrated

#### Task 2: Improve Image Selection üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Problem**: Irrelevant stock images from bad keyword extraction
- **Solution**: Better keyword extraction, skip dated/short titles
- **Container**: markdown-generator
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Cost**: No change

**Ready to implement**: Simple logic improvements, no new dependencies

#### Task 3: Slug-based URLs üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Problem**: Verbose URLs like `/20251016_104549_mastodon_...`
- **Solution**: Use article slugs: `/articles/2025/10/windows-zero-days/`
- **Container**: site-publisher
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours
- **Impact**: Better SEO, human-readable URLs

**Ready to implement**: Slugs already in processed JSON, just need to use them

## üéØ Next Actions

### Option 1: Start Phase 2 Implementation (Recommended)
Begin with Task 1 (AI Title Generation) as it has highest impact:

```bash
# Navigate to content-processor
cd containers/content-processor

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/ai-title-generation

# Implement title generation function
# Add tests
# Deploy via CI/CD
```

### Option 2: Verify Phase 1 Deployment First
Wait for current CI/CD to complete and verify fixes in production:

```bash
# Check CI/CD status
gh run watch

# After deployment, verify example article
curl https://aicontentprodstkwakpx.z33.web.core.windows.net/processed/...
```

### Option 3: Address Other Priority Work
If other work is more urgent, Phase 2 can wait. Phase 1 fixes make articles functional and readable.

## üîç Monitoring & Validation

After Phase 1 deployment completes:

1. **Check deployment logs**:
   ```bash
   az containerapp logs show -n markdown-generator-ca -g ai-content-prod-rg --follow
   ```

2. **Verify with test article**:
   - Visit published article URL
   - Confirm content is visible
   - Check source attribution
   - Test source link

3. **Monitor next batch**:
   - Wait for next collection cycle
   - Check newly published articles
   - Verify all fixes applied

---

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Start Phase 2 Task 1 (AI Title Generation)** - Highest user-facing impact
2. **Run incrementally** - Deploy each task separately for safety
3. **Keep rollback ready** - Each task has independent rollback capability
4. **Monitor costs** - AI title generation adds minimal cost (~$1/month)
