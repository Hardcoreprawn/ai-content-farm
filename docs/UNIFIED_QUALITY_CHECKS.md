# Unified Quality Checks - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a unified quality check system that runs the same tools locally and in GitHub Actions, covering both Python code quality and YAML/workflow validation.

## Architecture

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/code-quality-on-commit.yml` 
- **Triggers**: Push to any branch, Pull Requests to main/develop
- **Smart Detection**: Only runs checks for changed file types
- **Jobs**:
  1. `detect-changes` - Determines which types of files changed
  2. `python-quality` - Runs if Python files changed (uses `scripts/code-quality.sh`)
  3. `workflow-quality` - Runs if workflow files changed (uses `.github/actions/lint-workflows`)
  4. `quality-summary` - Provides unified reporting and PR comments

### Local Development Commands

#### Primary Commands (GitHub Actions Compatible)
- `make quality-check` - Smart quality checks matching GitHub Actions behavior
- `make lint-all` - Run all checks (always runs everything)

#### Python Quality Tools
- `make lint-python` - Core Python linting (flake8 + black + isort) [shared with CI]
- `make lint-python-all` - All Python checks including types and complexity
- `make format-python` - Auto-format Python code (black + isort)
- Individual tools: `make flake8`, `make black-check`, `make mypy`, etc.

#### Workflow Quality Tools  
- `make lint-workflows` - YAML/GitHub Actions linting (yamllint + actionlint)

#### Container-Specific
- `make lint-container CONTAINER=content-generator` - Lint specific container

### Shared Scripts
- **`scripts/code-quality.sh`** - Used by both GitHub Actions and local development
  - Runs: black --check, isort --check-only, flake8
  - Optional: mypy and pylint (disabled by default)
  - Consistent behavior across environments

### Key Features

#### Smart File Detection
Both GitHub Actions and `make quality-check` detect which files changed and only run relevant checks:
- Python files (*.py, requirements*.txt, pyproject.toml, .flake8) → Python quality checks  
- Workflow files (.github/workflows/*.yml, .github/actions/**/*.yml) → Workflow quality checks

#### Unified Configuration
- **`.flake8`** - Python linting configuration (shared across all containers)
- **`.yamllint.yml`** - YAML linting configuration
- **`pyproject.toml`** - Python project settings

#### Error Reporting
- **GitHub Actions**: Automatic PR comments with specific remediation steps
- **Local Development**: Direct terminal output with clear error messages

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Same tools, same configs, same scripts everywhere
2. **Efficiency**: Only runs checks for changed file types
3. **Developer Experience**: Clear local commands matching CI behavior
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for quality standards
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new tools to shared scripts

## Usage Examples

### Before Committing
```bash
# Run the same checks as GitHub Actions will
make quality-check

# Fix any formatting issues automatically  
make format-python

# Run all checks (useful for final verification)
make lint-all
```

### Container Development
```bash
# Lint specific container
make lint-container CONTAINER=content-generator

# Format all Python in a container
cd containers/content-generator && ../../scripts/code-quality.sh --fix
```

### Workflow Development
```bash
# Lint GitHub Actions workflows
make lint-workflows

# Check specific workflow file
yamllint .github/workflows/new-workflow.yml
actionlint .github/workflows/new-workflow.yml
```

## Implementation Details

### File Change Detection (GitHub Actions)
```bash
# Python changes
git diff --name-only $BEFORE..$SHA | grep -E '\.(py)$|requirements.*\.txt$|pyproject\.toml$|\.flake8$|scripts/code-quality\.sh$'

# Workflow changes  
git diff --name-only $BEFORE..$SHA | grep -E '\.github/(workflows|actions)/.*\.(yml|yaml)$'
```

### File Change Detection (Local)
```bash
# Uses git diff HEAD~1 to check against last commit
# Falls back to running all checks if not in git repo
```

This unified system ensures code quality standards are consistently enforced while providing an excellent developer experience both locally and in CI/CD pipelines.
