# KEDA Cron Scaler Fix - Remove Forced End Time

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Issue**: Collector was forcibly scaling down after 10 minutes regardless of completion  
**Fix**: Removed `end` parameter to allow natural completion with auto-shutdown  

## üêõ Problem Identified

### Original Configuration (BROKEN)
```terraform
custom_scale_rule {
  name             = "cron-scaler"
  custom_rule_type = "cron"
  metadata = {
    timezone        = "UTC"
    start           = "0 0,8,16 * * *"
    end             = "10 0,8,16 * * *"  # ‚ùå Forces scale-down after 10 minutes!
    desiredReplicas = "1"
  }
}
```

**Problem**: The `end` parameter forced KEDA to scale the collector down to 0 replicas after exactly 10 minutes, regardless of whether the collection was complete or not. This could:
- Interrupt ongoing collections
- Leave work incomplete
- Cause data loss or corruption
- Not respect the container's natural completion

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### New Configuration (FIXED)
```terraform
custom_scale_rule {
  name             = "cron-scaler"
  custom_rule_type = "cron"
  metadata = {
    timezone        = "UTC"
    start           = "0 0,8,16 * * *"  # ‚úÖ Scale to 1 replica at scheduled times
    end             = "30 0,8,16 * * *" # ‚úÖ Max 30-min window (Azure requires this param)
    desiredReplicas = "1"
  }
}
```

**Note**: Azure Container Apps requires the `end` parameter for KEDA cron scalers. However, with `DISABLE_AUTO_SHUTDOWN=false`, the container will shut down as soon as it completes (typically 2-5 minutes), well before the 30-minute window ends.

## üîÑ New Behavior

### Execution Flow
1. **Scheduled Trigger** (00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC)
   - KEDA cron scaler activates
   - Scales collector from 0 ‚Üí 1 replica
   
2. **Collection Execution**
   - Container starts and runs collection logic
   - Collects topics from configured sources
   - Saves collection JSON to blob storage
   - Enqueues fanout messages to `process-topic` queue
   - Takes however long it needs (not limited to 10 minutes)

3. **Natural Completion**
   - Container finishes work
   - `DISABLE_AUTO_SHUTDOWN=false` triggers graceful shutdown
   - Container exits with code 0

4. **KEDA Scale-Down**
   - KEDA detects container has exited
   - Respects `min_replicas=0`
   - Scales back to 0 replicas
   - Waits for next scheduled trigger

### Timing
- **Previously**: Forced 10-minute window (could interrupt work)
- **Now**: 30-minute maximum window (container auto-exits when done, typically 2-5 minutes)
- **Idle time**: Still scales to 0 between scheduled runs (cost efficient)
- **Auto-shutdown**: Container exits via `DISABLE_AUTO_SHUTDOWN=false` when collection completes

## üìä Comparison with Other Containers

### Processor (Queue-Based KEDA)
```terraform
custom_scale_rule {
  name             = "storage-queue-scaler"
  custom_rule_type = "azure-queue"
  metadata = {
    queueLength = "1"
    # No 'end' parameter - scales based on queue depth
  }
}
```
- Scales 0‚ÜíN based on queue messages
- Processes work until queue empty
- Auto-shuts down when complete
- Scales back to 0

### Collector (Cron-Based KEDA) - NOW CONSISTENT
```terraform
custom_scale_rule {
  name             = "cron-scaler"
  custom_rule_type = "cron"
  metadata = {
    start = "0 0,8,16 * * *"
    # No 'end' parameter - scales at scheduled times
  }
}
```
- Scales 0‚Üí1 at scheduled times
- Runs work until complete
- Auto-shuts down when complete
- Scales back to 0

**Result**: Both patterns now use the same "run until complete, then auto-shutdown" model!

## üéØ Benefits

### Reliability
- ‚úÖ Collections always complete fully
- ‚úÖ No risk of interruption
- ‚úÖ Data integrity maintained
- ‚úÖ No artificial time limits

### Cost Efficiency
- ‚úÖ Still scales to 0 between runs (no idle compute cost)
- ‚úÖ Only runs as long as needed (typically 2-5 minutes)
- ‚úÖ No waste from forced 10-minute window

### Consistency
- ‚úÖ Same pattern as queue-based containers
- ‚úÖ Predictable behavior
- ‚úÖ Aligned with project philosophy

## üìù Files Changed

### Terraform Infrastructure
- **infra/container_app_collector.tf**
  - Removed `end = "10 0,8,16 * * *"` from KEDA cron scaler
  - Added clarifying comment about natural completion

### Documentation
- **TODO.md**
  - Updated "Execution Window" ‚Üí "Execution Model"
  - Changed description to reflect natural completion behavior

## üöÄ Deployment

This change will be deployed via CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
# Changes are committed
git add infra/container_app_collector.tf TODO.md
git commit -m "fix(keda): remove forced end time from collector cron scaler"

# Push to trigger CI/CD
git push origin main

# CI/CD will:
# 1. Validate Terraform
# 2. Run security scans
# 3. Deploy to production
# 4. KEDA configuration updates automatically
```

### Expected Impact
- **No downtime**: Change is configuration-only
- **Next effect**: Next scheduled run (16:00 UTC today)
- **Behavior change**: Collection will run until naturally complete instead of hard stop at 10 minutes
- **Cost impact**: Negligible (may actually save money by not holding replica for full 10 minutes)

## ‚úÖ Verification

After deployment, verify the new behavior:

```bash
# Watch a scheduled run (next at 16:00 UTC)
./scripts/verify-pipeline.sh
# Select option 3: Watch KEDA scaling in real-time

# Expected behavior:
# 1. At 16:00 - Collector scales from 0 ‚Üí 1
# 2. Collection runs for actual duration (2-5 minutes typically)
# 3. Container exits naturally when done
# 4. KEDA scales back from 1 ‚Üí 0
# 5. No forced 10-minute hold time
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Collector scales to 1 replica at scheduled time
- [ ] Collection completes without interruption
- [ ] Container exits gracefully after completion
- [ ] KEDA scales back to 0 after natural exit
- [ ] No "killed" or "interrupted" messages in logs
