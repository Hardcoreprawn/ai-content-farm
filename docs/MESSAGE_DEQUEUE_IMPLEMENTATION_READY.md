## üéØ The Problem (What You Asked Me To Investigate)

You have a **critical reliability issue** in your message queue handling:

| Issue | Current | Problem |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Visibility Timeout** | 600 seconds (hardcoded) | 6-10x too long |
| **Processing Time** | 15-90 seconds | Much faster than timeout |
| **Deletion Verification** | None | Fire-and-forget, fails silently |
| **Deduplication** | None | If message reappears, processes again |
| **Monitoring** | Unknown | Can't see if duplicates happening |

**Risk**: Messages could be processed 2-3 times, wasting compute and creating duplicate articles.

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution (What I've Planned)

### 5-Phase Implementation

**Phase 1: Audit & Measurement** (4-6 hours)
- Collect baseline processing times
- Identify exact issues
- Output: Recommendations

**Phase 2: Optimize Timeouts** (8-12 hours)
- Replace 600s hardcoded timeout
- Calculate per-container values (60-180s)
- Remove timeout waste

**Phase 3: Deletion Verification** (6-8 hours)
- Add retry logic for failed deletes
- Verify message actually deleted
- Result: >99% deletion success

**Phase 4: Deduplication** (10-14 hours)
- Track processed messages
- Detect duplicates if they appear
- Result: Zero duplicate processing

**Phase 5: Monitoring** (4-6 hours)
- Application Insights queries
- Alert rules for failures
- Production dashboard

**Total Effort**: 40-58 hours (2-3 weeks) or 8-12 hours for quick win (Phase 2 only)

## üöÄ How to Get Started

### Step 1: Read (1 hour)
```bash
# Read in this order:
1. MESSAGE_DEQUEUE_INDEX.md (10 min) - Navigation
2. MESSAGE_DEQUEUE_SUMMARY.md (15 min) - Overview
3. MESSAGE_DEQUEUE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (10 min) - Quick facts
4. MESSAGE_DEQUEUE_CODE_AUDIT.md (15 min) - See current problems
5. MESSAGE_DEQUEUE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (45 min) - Deep dive
```

### Step 2: Decide (15 min)
- Full implementation (all 5 phases)? Or quick win (Phase 2 only)?
- Who implements?
- When to start?

### Step 3: Execute
- Create GitHub issues for each phase
- Follow the implementation plan
- Reference quick_reference.md while coding
- Use code examples from implementation_plan.md

## üí° Key Insights From the Analysis

### Current Issues Identified

**Issue #1**: Hardcoded `visibility_timeout=600` in `libs/queue_client.py:229`
- 6-10x too long for actual processing time
- Same setting for all operations (wrong!)

**Issue #2**: Inconsistent timeout config
- Some use 600s, some use defaults
- No container awareness
- Can't tune per operation

**Issue #3**: No deletion verification
- Delete message but don't confirm it worked
- Transient network errors ‚Üí lost messages

**Issue #4**: No deduplication
- If message reappears (due to timeout), processes again
- No detection possible
- Duplicates accumulate

**Issue #5**: No monitoring
- Don't know if duplicates happening
- Can't measure duplicate rate
- Can't optimize without data

### Recommended Timeouts (After Optimization)

| Container | Current | Recommended | Why |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-----|
| content-collector | 600s | 180s | Batch collection, 30-120s |
| content-processor | 600s | 90s | Stable 45-60s processing |
| markdown-generator | 72s | 60s | Fast 15-30s generation |
| site-publisher | 600s | 180s | Variable 60-120s builds |
