# OIDC Authentication and Production Deployment

This commit implements secure OIDC authentication with Azure Managed Identity and simplifies the deployment strategy to production-only, with ephemeral staging environments planned for later.

## Changes Made
- ✅ Implemented Azure Managed Identity with federated identity credentials
- ✅ Updated GitHub Actions to use OIDC instead of stored secrets  
- ✅ Configured remote Terraform state with network restrictions
- ✅ Simplified workflow to production-only deployment from main branch
- ✅ Added Infracost API key for cost analysis

## Security Improvements
- Zero stored secrets in GitHub (except Infracost API key)
- 15-minute token rotation with OIDC
- Network-restricted storage account for state files
- Proper RBAC permissions for all components

Ready for production deployment!
