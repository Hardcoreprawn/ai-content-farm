### Current KEDA Settings

| Container | Queue | Min | Max | queueLength | activationLength |
|-----------|-------|-----|-----|-------------|------------------|
| **Collector** | content-collection-requests | 0 | 1 | N/A | N/A |
| **Processor** | content-processing-requests | 0 | 6 | 8 | 1 |
| **Markdown** | markdown-generation-requests | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| **Publisher** | site-publishing-requests | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

### What the Settings Mean

**Collector:** Manual trigger only (no auto-scaling)
- Only runs when you explicitly start it
- Single replica sufficient for collection jobs

**Processor:** Auto-scales based on workload
- `queueLength=8` → 1 replica per 8 messages
- `max_replicas=6` → Can handle up to 48 messages in parallel
- This is your main scalable processing stage

**Markdown/Publisher:** Fast, single-replica stages
- `queueLength=1` → Very responsive
- Limited to 1 replica by design (file consistency)
- Process quickly enough to not be bottlenecks

## 🎓 Understanding the Dashboard

### Normal Operation
```
Queue Depths
   Collection Queue:       0 messages  ← Empty (manual trigger)
   Processing Queue:      15 messages  ← Healthy queue depth
   Markdown Queue:         2 messages  ← Fast processing
   Publishing Queue:       0 messages  ← Waiting for work

Container Replicas
   Collector:        0 / 1 replicas    ← Idle
   Processor:        2 / 6 replicas    ← Scaling as needed
   Markdown:         1 / 1 replicas    ← Active
   Publisher:        0 / 1 replicas    ← Idle

Pipeline Flow Analysis
   ✓ Pipeline healthy - steady processing rate
```

### Problem Scenario
```
Queue Depths
   Collection Queue:       0 messages
   Processing Queue:     125 messages  ⚠️ GROWING
   Markdown Queue:        45 messages  ⚠️ BACKING UP
   Publishing Queue:       8 messages

Container Replicas
   Collector:        0 / 1 replicas
   Processor:        6 / 6 replicas    ⚠️ AT MAX CAPACITY
   Markdown:         1 / 1 replicas
   Publisher:        1 / 1 replicas

Pipeline Flow Analysis
   ⚠️ BOTTLENECK: Large processing queue - may need more replicas
   ⚠️ SLOW: Markdown queue backing up - KEDA may need tuning
```

**This tells you:**
1. Processor is at max capacity (6/6)
2. Queue still growing despite max replicas
3. Need to either:
   - Increase max_replicas from 6 to higher
   - Decrease queueLength to scale faster
   - Optimize processing code

## 🔧 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Is my pipeline stuck?"

**Command:**
```bash
make monitor-pipeline
```

**Look for:**
- Queues with messages but replicas=0 (KEDA not triggering)
- Queues growing over time (bottleneck)
- Replicas at max but queue still growing (capacity issue)

### Scenario 2: "Should I change my KEDA settings?"

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Collect baseline
make monitor-collect DURATION=30

# 2. Trigger some work (your normal workload)

# 3. Analyze
make analyze-scaling

# 4. Review recommendations
```

**You'll get specific advice like:**
```
💡 Recommendations:
   • Queue depth reached 250 but avg replicas only 3.2.
     Consider decreasing queueLength from 8 to 4

📝 Terraform Configuration for processor:
custom_scale_rule {
  metadata = {
    queueLength           = "4"  # Changed from 8
    activationQueueLength = "1"
  }
}
```

### Scenario 3: "How fast is my pipeline?"

**Command:**
```bash
make analyze-flow DURATION=60
```

**You'll get:**
```
📊 Overall Metrics:
   Total Items Tracked: 45
   Completed Items: 42
   Throughput: 42 items/hour

⏱️  Stage Durations (Average):
   Collection:   12.3s
   Processing:  145.2s  🔴 BOTTLENECK
   Markdown:      8.1s
   Publishing:   15.4s

📈 End-to-End Times:
   Average: 180.8s (3.0 min)
   P95:     245.3s (4.1 min)

💡 Recommendations:
   • Processing is the bottleneck (145.2s avg)
   • Consider increasing max_replicas for content-processor
   • Check if hitting OpenAI rate limits
```

### Scenario 4: "Load testing before scaling up"

**Process:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start monitoring
make monitor-collect DURATION=60

# Terminal 2: Trigger large collection job
# (your specific trigger mechanism)

# After completion, analyze
make analyze-scaling
make analyze-flow DURATION=60
```

This shows you:
- Maximum queue depths reached
- How replicas scaled under load
- Whether you hit capacity limits
- If current settings are optimal

## 📝 Making Changes

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** All infrastructure changes via CI/CD only!

### Step 1: Update Terraform
```bash
# Edit the appropriate file
vim infra/container_app_processor.tf

# Change KEDA settings based on recommendations
template {
  min_replicas = 0
  max_replicas = 10  # Increased from 6
}

custom_scale_rule {
  metadata = {
    queueLength           = "4"  # Changed from 8
    activationQueueLength = "1"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Deploy via Git
```bash
git checkout -b optimize-processor-scaling
git add infra/container_app_processor.tf
git commit -m "Optimize processor KEDA scaling

- Increase max_replicas from 6 to 10 for higher capacity
- Decrease queueLength from 8 to 4 for faster response
- Based on analysis showing queue depths of 250+ messages"
git push origin optimize-processor-scaling

# Create PR to main
# CI/CD runs: security → cost analysis → deployment
# Merge to deploy
```

### Step 3: Monitor After Deployment
```bash
# Collect new metrics
make monitor-collect DURATION=30

# Compare to baseline
make analyze-scaling FILE=metrics-after-change.csv
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Daily Monitoring (2 minutes)
```bash
# Quick health check
make monitor-pipeline --interval 10 --duration 2
```

Look for:
- All queues < 100 messages
- No "BOTTLENECK" warnings
- Replicas scaling appropriately

### Weekly Analysis (30 minutes)
```bash
# Collect data
make monitor-collect DURATION=30

# Analyze trends
make analyze-scaling
make analyze-flow DURATION=30
```

Review:
- Average throughput meets requirements
- No capacity warnings
- Any new optimization opportunities

### After Infrastructure Changes
```bash
# Before: Collect baseline
make monitor-collect DURATION=30

# Deploy changes via CI/CD

# After: Collect comparison data
make monitor-collect DURATION=30

# Analyze impact
make analyze-scaling
```

Ensure:
- Queue depths improved or stable
- Scaling more responsive
- No new bottlenecks introduced
- Costs within budget

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Monitor shows all zeros"
```bash
# Check authentication
az login

# Verify resource group
az group list --query "[].name" -o table

# Run with explicit resource group
./scripts/monitor-pipeline-performance.sh --resource-group ai-content-prod-rg
```

### "KEDA not scaling despite queue messages"
```bash
# Check KEDA authentication
az containerapp show \
  --name ai-content-prod-processor \
  --resource-group ai-content-prod-rg \
  --query "properties.template.scale" -o json

# Verify managed identity permissions
az role assignment list \
  --assignee <container-identity-id> \
  --scope <storage-account-scope>

# Check for KEDA errors in logs
az monitor log-analytics query \
  -w <workspace-id> \
  --analytics-query "ContainerAppSystemLogs_CL | where Log_s contains 'keda'"
```

### "Python analysis fails"
```bash
# Install numpy (required dependency)
pip install numpy

# Or use dev container (has everything pre-installed)
```
