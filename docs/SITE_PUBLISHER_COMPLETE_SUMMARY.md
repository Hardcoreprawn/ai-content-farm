# Site Publisher Fixes - Complete Summary

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**PR:** Ready for deployment via CI/CD pipeline

## Executive Summary

Fixed three critical issues in the site-publisher container that were preventing successful deployments:

1. ✅ **Increased build output size limit** (100 MB → 200 MB) to accommodate 4,000+ article sites
2. ✅ **Added early validation** to prevent wasted backup operations on doomed deployments
3. ✅ **Added graceful cancellation handling** to prevent cryptic errors during container shutdown
4. ✅ **Improved tests** to focus on contracts and behavior, not implementation details

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Build Output Too Large (CRITICAL)
**Log Evidence:**
```
Build output too large: 120.1 MB
Deployment failed - rolled back to previous version
```

**Root Cause:**  
Hardcoded 100 MB limit in `security.py` line 174 was too restrictive for production sites with 4,000+ articles generating 120 MB of output.

**Fix:**  
```python
# Before
max_size = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # 100 MB

# After
max_size = 200 * 1024 * 1024  # 200 MB (increased for 4000+ article sites)
```

**Impact:** Site deployments will now succeed instead of falsely failing validation.

### Issue #2: Validation Happens Too Late
**Log Evidence:**
```
09:44:36 Backed up 2166 files  # 60+ seconds
09:45:39 Backed up 2166 files  # Another 60+ seconds
09:45:42 Deployment failed completely
```

**Root Cause:**  
Validation happened inside `deploy_to_web_container()` AFTER backup completed, wasting 60+ seconds on operations that would fail validation.

**Fix:**  
Added early validation in `site_builder.py` before attempting deployment:
```python
# Validate before attempting deployment
from security import validate_hugo_output
validation = validate_hugo_output(public_dir)
if not validation.is_valid:
    logger.error(f"Hugo output validation failed: {validation.errors}")
    return DeploymentResult(...)
```

**Impact:**  
- Failed builds return in ~1 second instead of ~130 seconds
- No unnecessary backup/rollback operations
- Clearer error messages

### Issue #3: Shutdown Errors During Long Operations
**Log Evidence:**
```
09:48:24 INFO: Shutting down
09:48:24 WARNING: Error e23fadb3: AssertionError in site-publisher
09:48:24 WARNING: Error fc695ece: ValueError in site-publisher
09:48:24 WARNING: Error 63564d40: ValueError in site-publisher
```

**Root Cause:**  
Container receives SIGTERM shutdown signal while backup/rollback/upload operations are running (60-70 seconds for 2,166+ files), causing incomplete operations and cryptic errors.

**Fix:**  
Added `asyncio.CancelledError` handling in all long-running operations:
```python
except asyncio.CancelledError:
    logger.warning(f"Operation cancelled during shutdown after {completed}/{total} files")
    raise  # Re-raise to propagate cancellation
```

Also added progress logging every 500 files to track operations.

**Impact:**  
- Clear warning messages when shutdown interrupts operations
- No more cryptic error correlation IDs
- Better operational visibility

     - `rollback_deployment()`
   - Added progress logging every 500 files

### Test Code
4. **`containers/site-publisher/tests/test_site_builder.py`**

   - Enhanced test documentation with Contract and Behavior sections
   - Improved assertion messages for clarity
   - All 63 tests passing ✅

All tests passing with clear contract and behavior validation ✅

## Performance Impact

### Before (Failed Build)
- Download: ~33 seconds
- Organize: ~10 seconds  
- Build: ~33 seconds
- Backup: ~60 seconds ⚠️ (wasted)
- Validation: Fails
- Rollback: ~70 seconds ⚠️ (wasted)
- **Total: ~206 seconds** with deployment failure

### After (Successful Build)
- Download: ~33 seconds
- Organize: ~10 seconds
- Build: ~33 seconds
- **Validation: ~1 second** ✅ (fails fast)
- ~~Backup: skipped~~
- ~~Rollback: skipped~~
- **Total: ~77 seconds** for validation failure OR full deployment success

**Time saved per failed build: ~129 seconds**

### After (Valid Build with New Limit)
- Download: ~33 seconds
- Organize: ~10 seconds
- Build: ~33 seconds
- Validation: ~1 second ✅ (passes)
- Backup: ~60 seconds
- Deploy: ~variable
- **Total: ~137+ seconds** for successful deployment

**Deployments now succeed instead of failing**

### Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Site builds complete successfully (no "Build output too large" error)
- [ ] Validation happens before backup (check log timestamps)
- [ ] No cryptic errors during container shutdown
- [ ] Progress logs appear every 500 files during long operations
- [ ] Build times are reasonable (~130-200 seconds for full deployment)
- [ ] Failed validations return quickly (~77 seconds instead of ~206 seconds)

### Monitoring

Watch these metrics post-deployment:

```bash
# Monitor site-publisher logs
az containerapp logs tail \
  --name ai-content-prod-site-publisher \
  --resource-group ai-content-prod-rg \
  --follow

# Check Application Insights
# Look for:
# - Reduced error rates
# - Faster validation failures
# - No more AssertionError/ValueError at shutdown
# - Clear cancellation warnings if shutdown occurs mid-operation
```

## Breaking Changes

**None.** All changes are backward compatible:
- No API changes
- No environment variable changes
- No infrastructure changes
- Existing functionality preserved
- Only internal validation logic improved

## Related Issues

These fixes address production deployment failures where:
1. Hugo successfully built 4,017 files (120.1 MB)
2. Security validation rejected output as "too large"
3. Unnecessary backup and rollback operations executed
4. Container shutdown interrupted rollback
5. Cryptic errors logged during shutdown

## Future Improvements

1. **Configurable size limit**: Add `MAX_BUILD_OUTPUT_MB` environment variable
2. **Parallel uploads**: Use `asyncio.gather()` for faster deployment (10-20x)
3. **Checkpoint/resume**: Handle interrupted operations gracefully
4. **Structured progress**: Emit progress events for KEDA scaling decisions
5. **Property-based tests**: Use Hypothesis for contract validation
6. **Performance baselines**: Establish SLOs for deployment times

## Success Criteria

✅ Build output limit accommodates production sites (4,000+ articles, 120 MB)  
✅ Validation happens before expensive operations  
✅ Graceful handling of shutdown interruptions  
✅ Clear error messages (no cryptic correlation IDs)  
✅ All tests passing with clear contracts and behavior  
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality  
✅ Documentation updated with fixes and testing philosophy
