# Container Build Optimization Analysis

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Current Status**: ~3-4 minutes per full pipeline run  
**Goal**: Reduce to <2 minutes

## Current Build Analysis

### Current Build Times (Estimated from CI/CD)
- **Security scans**: ~40s (already optimized with Semgrep consolidation)
- **Container builds**: ~60-90s per container (4 containers = 4-6 minutes if serial)
- **Tests**: ~30s per container
- **Deployment**: ~40s

### Bottlenecks Identified

#### 1. **Python Dependencies Installation** (BIGGEST BOTTLENECK)
- Each container reinstalls similar dependencies
- `pip install` is slow even with `--no-cache-dir`
- Multi-stage builds help but still rebuild layers often

#### 2. **Layer Caching Inefficiency**
- GitHub Actions cache (`type=gha`) is enabled but not fully optimized
- Cache invalidation happens on any code change
- Shared `libs/` directory changes invalidate all container caches

#### 3. **Serial Container Builds**
- Currently building containers one at a time in matrix
- Could parallelize more aggressively

#### 4. **Repeated Base Image Downloads**
- `python:3.11-slim` downloaded for each container build
- ~50MB compressed, ~150MB uncompressed

## Optimization Strategies

### 🚀 Quick Wins (Implement First)

#### 1. Switch to UV Package Manager (70% faster)
**Status**: Already implemented in `content-collector`!

```dockerfile
# Before (pip): ~60s for dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# After (UV): ~15-20s for same dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir uv==0.4.23
RUN uv pip install --system --no-cache -r requirements.txt
```

**Action**: Migrate all containers to UV
- ✅ content-collector (DONE)
- ⏳ content-processor (TODO)
- ⏳ markdown-generator (TODO)
- ⏳ site-generator (TODO)

**Expected Savings**: 40-45s per container × 3 containers = **2-2.5 minutes**

#### 2. Optimize Dependency Layer Ordering
Move least-frequently-changed dependencies to earlier layers:

```dockerfile
# BEFORE: Single requirements file (invalidates on any change)
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .

# AFTER: Split by change frequency
# Base dependencies (rarely change)
COPY requirements-base.txt .
RUN uv pip install --system -r requirements-base.txt

# Project-specific (change more often)
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN uv pip install --system -r requirements.txt

# Application code (changes most frequently)
COPY . .
```

**Expected Savings**: Cache hits 80% of the time = **30-40s average**

#### 3. Use BuildKit Cache Mounts
Add cache mounts for pip/uv cache directories:

```dockerfile
# Current (no cache reuse between builds)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Optimized (cache reused between builds)
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Expected Savings**: **20-30s** on cache hits

#### 4. Create Shared Base Image
Build a common base image with shared dependencies:

```dockerfile
# base-image.Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir uv==0.4.23
# Install common dependencies
COPY shared-requirements.txt .
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/opt/uv-cache \
    uv pip install --system -r shared-requirements.txt
```

Then in each container:
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/hardcoreprawn/ai-content-farm-base:latest
# Only install container-specific dependencies
```

**Expected Savings**: **30-45s per container** (downloads 1 image vs 4)

### 🎯 Medium-Term Optimizations

#### 5. Parallel Container Builds with Dependencies
Use GitHub Actions matrix strategically:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    container: [content-collector, markdown-generator]
    # Build processor and site-gen in separate job (they don't block deployment)
```

**Expected Savings**: **1-2 minutes** (parallel execution)

#### 6. Pre-compile Python Bytecode
Add to Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# After copying code
RUN python -m compileall -b .
RUN find . -name "*.py" -delete
```

**Expected Savings**: **5-10s faster startup**, not build time

#### 7. Dependency Vendoring for Critical Path
For containers on the critical deployment path:

```dockerfile
# Pre-download wheels to repository
COPY vendor/wheels/ /tmp/wheels/
RUN pip install --no-index --find-links=/tmp/wheels -r requirements.txt
```

**Expected Savings**: **30-40s** (no network downloads)

### 🏗️ Long-Term Optimizations

#### 8. Move to Pre-built Base Images
Create monthly refreshed base images with all common dependencies:

```bash
# Automated monthly rebuild
ghcr.io/hardcoreprawn/ai-content-farm-base:2025-10
```

**Expected Savings**: **50-60s per container**

#### 9. Use GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Runners
Persistent disk cache, faster network:

**Expected Savings**: **40-50%** total build time reduction

#### 10. Implement Smart Build Skipping
Only build changed containers:

```yaml
- name: Check if container changed
  id: filter
  uses: dorny/paths-filter@v2
  with:
    filters: |
      collector:
        - 'containers/content-collector/**'
        - 'libs/**'
```

**Expected Savings**: **60-80%** on PRs (skip unchanged containers)

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (This Week)
1. ✅ Migrate markdown-generator to UV (~30s savings)
2. ✅ Migrate content-processor to UV (~30s savings)
3. ✅ Add BuildKit cache mounts to all Dockerfiles (~20s savings)
4. ✅ Split requirements files by stability (~20s savings)

**Total Phase 1 Savings**: ~1.5-2 minutes (50-60% reduction)

### Phase 2: Architecture (Next Sprint)
5. ⏳ Create shared base image pipeline
6. ⏳ Implement smart build skipping
7. ⏳ Optimize parallel execution strategy

**Total Phase 2 Savings**: Additional 1-1.5 minutes

### Phase 3: Infrastructure (Month 2)
8. ⏳ Evaluate self-hosted runners
9. ⏳ Implement dependency vendoring
10. ⏳ Set up automated base image rebuilds

**Total Phase 3 Savings**: Additional 30-45s

## Expected Final Results

| Phase | Build Time | Improvement |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Current | ~3-4 min | Baseline |
| Phase 1 | ~1.5-2 min | 50-60% ↓ |
| Phase 2 | ~1 min | 70-75% ↓ |
| Phase 3 | ~45s | 80% ↓ |

## Metrics to Track

```yaml
# Add to each build step
- name: Build ${{ matrix.container }}
  run: |
    start_time=$(date +%s)
    docker build ...
    end_time=$(date +%s)
    build_duration=$((end_time - start_time))
    echo "::notice::Build time for ${{ matrix.container }}: ${build_duration}s"
```
