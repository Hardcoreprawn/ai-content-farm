DEPRECATED: Tests for complex adaptive collection strategies
Status: REMOVED - File emptied as part of simplified architecture migration

These tests were for the complex adaptive strategy system that was causing
CI/CD pipeline failures. The file content has been removed and the file
kept only for reference.

Original purpose: Tested Reddit, Web, and RSS specific adaptive collection behaviors.
Replacement: Simple tests in test_simplified_collectors.py with basic retry logic.
