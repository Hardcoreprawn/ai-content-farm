# Example: Updated Content Generator Dockerfile
# Shows how containers become MUCH simpler with common base

# Use our common base image with all shared dependencies pre-installed
FROM ai-content-farm/base:latest

# Only install SPECIFIC dependencies for this container
COPY containers/content-generator/requirements-specific.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements-specific.txt

# Copy application code
COPY containers/content-generator/ .

# Switch to non-root user (already created in base)
USER appuser

# Set container-specific environment
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
