Content Processing Core - Pure Functions

This module contains pure business logic functions for content processing,
following functional programming principles for thread safety and scalability.

All functions here are:
- Pure functions (no side effects)
- Deterministic (same input â†’ same output)
- Thread-safe
- Easy to test and reason about

Side effects (storage, HTTP, logging) are handled by the router layer.
