- Configured devcontainer.json to clone the repository into a Docker volume by default for optimal file I/O performance (especially for Terraform and similar tools).
---

- Removed duplicate devcontainer features for Terraform, Azure CLI, and common-utils from devcontainer.json since all tools are now installed in the Dockerfile. This reduces build time and avoids confusion.

## Next steps for Copilot (after devcontainer rebuild)

1. Start the Azure Functions host locally in /functions: `func start`.
2. Test the GetHotTopics endpoint (e.g., with curl or browser) to verify it fetches live Reddit topics.
3. Display or log the output for user review.
4. If successful, proceed to wire up the Eleventy site to consume the functionâ€™s output and generate/update a static page.
5. Continue logging all user requests and actions in this file.
