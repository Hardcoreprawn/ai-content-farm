# CI/CD Pipeline Migration - Test Trigger

This file was created to test the new optimized CI/CD pipeline.

- **Date**: September 11, 2025
- **Purpose**: Validate optimized pipeline performance
- **Expected improvements**: 40-50% faster execution, simplified logic

## Test Status
✅ Pipeline migration complete
✅ Basic pipeline validation passed (13s runtime)
🔄 Full pipeline testing in progress...

### Current Test Run (Sep 11, 2025)
**Changes made to test pipeline paths:**
1. **Container changes**: Added monitoring.py to content-collector and content-processor
2. **Infrastructure changes**: Updated cost monitoring budget ($50 → $55)
3. **Documentation**: Updated main.tf with pipeline test comment

**Expected pipeline behavior:**
- ✅ Change detection should identify: containers + infrastructure
- ✅ Should trigger: container builds, tests, and infrastructure validation
- ✅ Should deploy: updated containers and Terraform state
- ⏱️ Expected runtime: 2-4 minutes (vs previous 8+ minutes)

The new pipeline should demonstrate:
1. Faster change detection
2. Parallel quality checks
3. Streamlined deployment process
4. Better error reporting
