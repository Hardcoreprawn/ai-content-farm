**Content Pipeline (Unchanged):**
```
Reddit/Web → content-collector → content-processor → site-generator → jablab.com
                                      ↑
                              Enhanced with AI Generation
                           (Processing + TLDR/Blog/Deepdive)
```

## 📋 Immediate Actions (This Week)

### Priority 1: Deploy Scheduler Infrastructure
```bash
# Deploy scheduler infrastructure
cd /workspaces/ai-content-farm/infra
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Verify Logic App creation
az logic workflow list --resource-group <resource-group>
```

### Priority 1: Verify KEDA Cron Configuration

```bash
# Verify KEDA cron scaler is configured
az containerapp show \
  --name ai-content-prod-collector \
  --resource-group ai-content-prod-rg \
  --query "properties.configuration.scale" -o json
```

### Priority 2: Monitor KEDA Scaling Events
```bash
# Check container scaling events and execution logs
az monitor activity-log list \
  --resource-group ai-content-prod-rg \
  --query "[?contains(resourceId, 'ai-content-prod-collector')]" \
  --max-events 20

# Check collections in blob storage
az storage blob list \
  --account-name aicontentprodstkwakpx \
  --container-name collected-content \
  --auth-mode login \
  --query "[?contains(name, '$(date +%Y/%m/%d)')]" -o table
```

### Priority 3: Test Manual Collection Trigger
```bash
# Test manual collection via API (for testing/debugging)
curl -X POST https://ai-content-prod-collector.whitecliff-6844954b.uksouth.azurecontainerapps.io/collections \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"template_name": "tech-news"}'

# Verify content-collector health
curl -X GET "https://ai-content-prod-collector.whitecliff-6844954b.uksouth.azurecontainerapps.io/health"
```

### Priority 4: End-to-End Pipeline Testing (Parallel)
```bash
# Test complete flow with KEDA cron scheduler
# 1. KEDA cron triggers content-collector startup at scheduled time
# 2. Content-collector fetches from approved templates
# 3. Content flows through storage queues to content-processor  
# 4. Site generation creates website from processed content
# 5. Monitor costs, performance, and collection frequency
```
