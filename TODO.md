**Content Pipeline (Unchanged):**
```
Reddit/Web → content-collector → content-processor → site-generator → jablab.com
                                      ↑
                              Enhanced with AI Generation
                           (Processing + TLDR/Blog/Deepdive)
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't add new features until basic scheduler works
- ❌ Don't create new documentation files (use existing structure)
- ❌ Don't over-engineer the Logic App workflow initially
