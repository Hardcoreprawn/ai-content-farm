# TODO

## **URGENT: Fix Terraform State Management** ðŸš¨
- [ ] **Configure Bootstrap Remote State**: Bootstrap is using local state but should migrate to remote state after creating storage account
- [ ] **Configure Application Backend**: Application has empty backend config, needs proper remote state setup
- [ ] **Create State Migration Process**: Document how to migrate bootstrap from local to remote state safely
- [ ] **Add Backend Config Files**: Create proper backend.hcl files for each environment
- [ ] **Test State Migration**: Verify bootstrap can migrate its own state to the storage account it creates

## Fix deployment
- [x] Run `scripts/fix-oidc-environment-credentials.sh`
- [x] Grant Azure permissions to OIDC service principal  
- [ ] Grant Azure AD application creation permissions
- [ ] Import existing resource group to Terraform state
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Test content generation works

## Clean up scripts
- [ ] Delete duplicate setup scripts
- [ ] Fix Makefile
- [ ] Test clean setup

## Add tests
- [ ] Unit tests for functions
- [ ] End-to-end test
- [ ] Add to CI/CD

## Pipeline Optimization
- [ ] **PRIORITY: Simplify GitHub Actions by reusing Makefile targets**
  - Benefits: Reduce duplication, easier maintenance, consistent behavior between local and CI
  - Current state: ~200 lines of duplicated tool installation and execution
  - Target: Replace with `make verify`, `make apply`, etc.
  - Considerations: Handle GitHub Actions-specific requirements (outputs, artifacts, environment variables)
  - Estimated savings: 60% reduction in workflow complexity

## Plan improvements
- [ ] Split up GetHotTopics function
- [ ] Design better content pipeline
- [ ] Research MCP integration

## Maintenance
- [ ] Update Terraform version (currently 1.12.2) quarterly
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions versions quarterly
- [ ] Update Python dependencies monthly
