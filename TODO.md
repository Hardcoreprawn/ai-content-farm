# TODO - AI Content Farm

**Status**: 🎉 **PHASE 1 COMPLETE** - MVP Logic App Successfully Deployed & Validated  
**Current Priority**: 🔧 **STORAGE QUEUE MIGRATION** - Fix Service Bus authentication issues  
**Next Priority**: 🔒 **SECURITY HARDENING** - Address security concerns before Phase 2  
**Goal**: Storage Queue migration → Secure foundation → Enhanced multi-topic scheduler intelligence

## ✅ Recent Achievements

### 🚨 URGENT: Service Bus Authentication Issue - BLOCKING WAKE-UP PATTERN
**Issue**: Container Apps managed identity conflicts with Service Bus connection strings for KEDA scaling
**Root Cause**: Azure Container Apps forces managed identity authentication, but KEDA Service Bus scaler requires connection strings
**Impact**: Wake-up messages remain unconsumed in Service Bus queue, blocking content processing automation
**Solution**: Migrate from Service Bus to Azure Storage Queues (supports both managed identity and KEDA scaling)

### 🔧 Storage Queue Migration Plan - IN PROGRESS
**Target**: Replace Service Bus with Storage Queues to resolve authentication conflicts

#### Phase 1: Infrastructure Migration ⏳
- [ ] **Remove Service Bus** from Terraform (`infra/container_apps.tf`)
- [ ] **Add Storage Queues** infrastructure with managed identity support
- [ ] **Update KEDA scaling rules** to use `azure-queue` scaler instead of `azure-servicebus`
- [ ] **Deploy infrastructure changes** and verify queue creation

#### Phase 2: Application Migration ⏳  
- [ ] **Create Storage Queue client** (`libs/storage_queue_client.py`) modeled after Service Bus client
- [ ] **Update wake-up pattern** to use Storage Queues instead of Service Bus
- [ ] **Modify all containers** to use Storage Queue client for message processing
- [ ] **Remove Service Bus dependencies** from all containers

#### Phase 3: Validation ⏳
- [ ] **Test wake-up pattern** end-to-end with Storage Queues
- [ ] **Verify KEDA scaling** works with managed identity authentication  
- [ ] **Validate message processing** in all containers
- [ ] **Document Storage Queue architecture** and benefits

### 🎯 Phase 1: MVP Scheduler - ✅ COMPLETED ✅
**Achievement**: **Complete end-to-end automated content collection pipeline operational**

**Validation Results (2025-09-09):**
- ✅ **30 Reddit posts collected** successfully via Logic App automation
- ✅ **46,926 bytes of content** saved to Azure Storage
- ✅ **Dynamic Terraform references** working (stable Container App FQDN)
- ✅ **Budget lifecycle optimization** prevents unnecessary recreation  
- ✅ **6-hour recurrence schedule** operational and validated

### Major Accomplishments Complete
1. **✅ Architecture Simplified** - Reduced from 4 to 3 containers (25% complexity reduction)
2. **✅ Content-Generator Merged** - AI generation functionality integrated into content-processor
3. **✅ API Standardization** - All containers use shared library pattern with consistent responses
4. **✅ Zero Regression** - All existing functionality preserved during integration
5. **✅ Enhanced Capabilities** - content-processor now handles both processing AND AI generation
6. **✅ Scheduler Design** - Comprehensive Azure Logic App scheduler design completed
7. **✅ MVP Scheduler Deployed** - Production Logic App with 6-hour recurrence successfully deployed
