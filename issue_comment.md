## ðŸŽ‰ Scheduler Infrastructure Now Available for Testing!

**Phase 1 MVP Logic App Scheduler Successfully Deployed** âœ…

The scheduler infrastructure needed for end-to-end testing is now complete and operational:

### Deployed Components
- **Azure Logic App**: ai-content-prod-scheduler with 6-hour recurrence
- **Managed Identity**: Secure authentication to content-collector
- **Budget Monitoring**: 5 USD monthly limit with cost alerts  
- **Resource Protection**: Resource group lock restored

### Ready for Testing
The scheduler is now actively running and will trigger content collection every 6 hours. This provides the perfect foundation for validating the complete pipeline flow.

### Next Steps for End-to-End Testing
1. **Monitor scheduled executions** - Logic App runs every 6 hours automatically
2. **Validate content flow** - Verify content moves through all pipeline stages  
3. **Test manual triggers** - Use Logic App manual trigger for immediate testing
4. **Check site generation** - Confirm jablab.com updates with new content

### Testing Resources Available
- Logic App workflow available in Azure Portal
- Scheduler budget: 5 USD monthly monitoring active
- Container Apps: All endpoints available for manual testing

**Ready to proceed with comprehensive end-to-end pipeline validation!**
