# Container Apps PR Consolidation Strategy

## Overview
We need strategic guidance on consolidating multiple Container Apps implementation PRs while maintaining our small, reviewable PR philosophy.

## PRs Requiring Review

### PR #6: Complete Container Apps Pipeline
- Large comprehensive implementation
- Need quality assessment and consolidation guidance

### PR #7: Complete Container Apps Pipeline  
- Alternative large implementation
- Need comparison with PR #6 and recommendation

### PR #8: Implement ContentEnricher Container Service
- Focused implementation with passing tests
- Appears to follow our architecture patterns

## Our Small PR Strategy (Established)

### ✅ PR #11: TDD Foundation
- Test contracts for all services
- Clean separation of concerns
- Ready for approval

### ✅ PR #12: Test Dependencies
- Enables full async testing workflow
- Required for TDD implementation
- Ready for approval

## Strategic Questions

1. **Quality Assessment**: Which of PRs #6, #7, #8 meet our quality standards?
2. **Consolidation Strategy**: How do we preserve valuable work while maintaining small PRs?
3. **Next Steps**: What's the optimal path to complete Container Apps migration?

## Architecture Requirements
- Pure functions model
- REST API standards
- Standard response formats
- Worker/Scheduler separation
- Observable operations
- Comprehensive testing

## Request
Please analyze the existing PRs and provide:
1. Quality assessment for each PR
2. Specific recommendations (approve/extract/close)
3. Next steps plan for completion
